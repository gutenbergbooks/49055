<p class='c014'>Of the five weeks I spent in Soviet Russia
ten days were spent in Moscow
and eight in Petrograd. The remainder of
the time I traveled along the Western Front,
from the Esthonian border to Moghilev, with
leisurely stops at Pskov, Vitebsk, Polotzk,
Smolensk, and numerous small towns. I tried
to see as much as possible of this vast and unknown
land in the short time at my disposal,
and I tried especially to check up from first-hand
observation some of the many things I
had heard on the outside. I also tried to test
the truth of what was told me in Russia itself,—to
find visible evidence of the fairness
of the claims made. Some popular fancies
were quickly dispelled. Disproof of others
came sometimes in vividly concrete fashion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soviet Russia is not unanimously Bolshevist,
any more than the United States has
ever been unanimously Democratic or Republican,
or Prohibitionist. The speculators
are not Bolshevist, nor are the irreconcilable
bourgeoisie, nor the Monarchists, nor the Cadets
nor the Menshevists, nor the Social Revolutionists
and Anarchists. Nevertheless Russia
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span>stands overwhelmingly in support of the
Soviet Government, just as the United States
stands overwhelmingly in support of Congress
and the Constitution. There are many who are
opposed to Soviet rule in its present form, and
this opposition is not confined to the old bourgeoisie
and the anarchists. It prevails to a certain
extent—variously estimated—among the
peasants. But it is an opposition which
ceases at the military frontier of the nation.
I found many critics of Soviet rule within
Soviet Russia, but they insisted that whatever
changes are to be made in the government
must be made without foreign interference.
At present their first interest is the
defence of Russian soil and the Russian state
against foreign assault and foreign interference.</p>

<p class='c000'>The peasant opposition is mainly due to
the deficiencies in transportation and the
shortage of manufactured articles. They
blame this on the government, much as other
peoples lay their troubles to “the government.”
The peasants are reluctant to give
up their grain for paper money which is of
no value to them unless it will buy shoes and
cloth and salt and tools,—and of these necessities
there are not enough to go round.
While the blockade continued the government
was striving vigorously to overcome the
shortage of manufactured articles brought
about by the blockade, knowing that this
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>alone would satisfy the peasants. They
claimed to have made encouraging progress,
especially in the production of agricultural
machinery, of which they were trying to have
the largest possible supply ready by spring.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whatever the state of mind of the peasants,
they are certainly better off materially
than the city workers. In all the villages I
visited I found the peasants faring much better
than were the Commissars in Moscow.
They had plentiful supplies of good rye
bread on their tables, with butter and eggs
and milk,—almost unknown luxuries in the
cities. Their cattle looked well fed and well
cared for. It was harvest time and the farmers
were gathering in their crops. They told
me that the season had been exceptionally
bountiful.</p>

<p class='c000'>I learned after my return to America that
there had been a great deal of agitation
among the upholders of the old Russian order
in this country last summer and early
fall over the pogroms which were said to
have been carried on by the Bolsheviki. I
found nothing but cooperation and sympathy
and understanding between the Russians and
the Jews. There was no discrimination whatsoever,
as far as I could see. Jews and Russians
share alike in the councils of the Soviet
Government and in the factories and workshops.</p>

<p class='c000'>In fact I found nothing but the utmost
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>kindness and good will towards the whole
world, all through Russia. "If they will only
let us alone they have nothing to fear from us,—not
even propaganda,"—was said to me over
and over again. There were no threats made
against the interventionists. The Soviet forces
merely went ahead and demonstrated their
strength and ability to defend themselves, and
left the record of their achievements to speak
for itself.</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>“You will never return alive. They will
slaughter you. They will rob you of
everything. They will take your clothes from
your very back.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With stubborn conviction the dapper young
Lettish gentleman spoke to me as he attempted
to change my mind about going into
Soviet Russia. He was attached to the
Foreign Information Bureau of Latvia. He
had been in Riga all through the Bolshevist
régime, from November, 1918, to May, 1919,
when the German army of occupation in the
Baltic provinces drove them out. There was
nothing he could not tell me about that
régime. He was especially eager to impart
his experiences to foreign journalists.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Was it really so terrible, then?” I asked
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Nothing could have been worse,” he repeated.
"Many persons were killed by the
Bolshevists—I saw them myself—but not so
many as when the Germans began their
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>slaughter. There was the Bolshevist program
of nationalization. They nationalized
the land. They nationalized the factories.
They nationalized the banks and the large
office buildings, and even the residences.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Aristocratic women were taken from their
comfortable homes and forced to wait on
Bolshevist Commissars in the Soviet dining-rooms.
One of our leading citizens, a man
who through hard work had accumulated a
great fortune, was put to work cleaning
streets. His fine house with thirty or forty
beautiful rooms, where he lived quite alone
with his wife and servants, was taken away
from him, and he was moved into a house in
another part of the city on a mean street
where he had never been before. His home
was taken over by the ‘state’ and seven families
of the so-called proletariat were lodged
in it. One of our generals was compelled to
sell newspapers on the streets. Our leading
artists were forced to paint lamp posts—and
the color was red. They made the university
students cut ice.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And the women—did they nationalize
them?” I interrupted.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, no, they didn’t do that here in
Riga,” he said, “but that was because they
were not here long enough to put it into effect.
They were so busy confiscating property in
the six months they held sway that they had
little time for anything else. No, they didn’t
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>nationalize the women in Riga, but you will
find they have done so in Moscow.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But you must not go to Moscow,” he
added. “You will surely never return alive—but
if you do, please come and tell me what
you have seen.” And mournfully he wished
me a safe journey.</p>

<p class='c000'>I returned to the Foreign Office the next
day determined to get permission at once to
pass through the Lettish front into Soviet
Russia. It was a hot August day. Officers
and attachés sat around panting, obviously
bored that any one should come at this time
to annoy them. Yet despite the heat, they
were willing enough to argue with me when
they learned that I wished to go into Soviet
Russia. Like the young man I talked to
before, they tried hard to dissuade me. They
were full of forebodings.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will be robbed of the clothes on your
back the minute you fall into the hands of
the Bolshevists,” they insisted.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You must be crazy,” said one particularly
friendly officer, whose blonde hair stood
straight up from his head so that he looked
perpetually frightened.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I am an American correspondent,” I
repeated over and over again, not knowing
what else to say.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So that is it,” said the officer, seeming to
understand all at once. And shortly after
that the Foreign Office at Riga decided to
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>recommend the General Staff that I be permitted
to pass the lines. But still they urged
me not to go.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will come back naked if you come
back alive,” they shouted to me in parting.</p>

<p class='c000'>I left Riga on a troop train at six o’clock
in the evening of September 1, 1919, bound
for Red Russia. By noon the following
day we had reached a small town, where I
disembarked with the soldiers. The front
was fifteen versts away. There the Reds had
established themselves, I was told, in old
German trenches near the town of Levenhoff,
107 versts from Riga.</p>

<p class='c000'>I carried a heavy suitcase, an overcoat and
an umbrella, and the thought of trudging in
the wake of the less heavily caparisoned soldiers
was discouraging. I accosted a smart
young officer with blonde mustaches. He listened
to me with interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am an American correspondent,” I said,
“accredited to your headquarters.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He glanced at my papers and shrugged his
shoulders with such an air of indifference
that I thought he was not going to help me
at all. But he told me to follow him, and a
short distance up the road we came upon a
peasant driving a crude hay-rick drawn by
a single gaunt horse.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a brief parley, none of which I understood,
the peasant got down from his high
seat, hoisted my suitcase into the vehicle, and
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>I followed it. I sat flat on the floor with my
feet braced against the sides of the springless
cart, and we started jolting and bumping
down the rough road which ran parallel with
the tracks. The peasant sat on a board laid
across the front of the rick.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had gone only a short way when the
booming of guns came from both sides of us.
My driver, however, seemed unconscious of
it. We went on for another five versts. The
guns grew louder and I saw shrapnel shells
burst uncomfortably near. They came thicker
and faster.</p>

<p class='c000'>I remembered the peace of Riga some
twenty-four hours before this. I wanted to
tell the driver to turn around and go back,
and then I remembered that we did not speak
the same language, and certainly, judging
from his impassive back, we were not thinking
the same thoughts. There was an instant
when I stopped thinking altogether, and when
I knew that I could not have opened my
mouth had I tried to speak. A shell burst
some forty feet away and a piece of shrapnel
about the size of a grape-fruit landed on the
floor of the hay-rick between my outspread
legs, broke two slats on the floor of the
wagon and dropped harmlessly to the ground.
Then at last the driver turned around, his face
white as chalk. His panic, instead of communicating
itself to me, had the very opposite
effect and I suddenly lost all sense of danger.
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>With a boldness, which surprises me whenever
I think of it, I shouted to him:</p>

<p class='c000'>“For Christ’s sake, go on!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The driver obeyed reluctantly but soon
turned around again.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go on!” I cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few minutes later we approached a
clump of trees under which stood a Lettish
gun, surrounded by four or five officers. My
driver stopped to talk to them, evidently inquiring
whether it was safe to go on. One
of the officers nodded, the others laughed, and
one said in good English, “Everything is all
right.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At four o’clock we reached the headquarters
at the front. I presented my pass to
the commanding officer, a stocky young fellow
with humorous wrinkles around his eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are an American,” he said, observing
me keenly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“From New York,” I said. “I am going
to Moscow on important business for my
paper.” I told him more, giving most impressive
details. I convinced him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” he said finally, “you will have to
wait until morning. Both of us are using
heavy artillery now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I insisted. I wanted to go at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, go then,” he said with his first show
of impatience. He called a lieutenant, gave
him brief instructions and washed his hands
of me.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>Right across the neutral zone you could see
the Bolshevist trenches, running at right
angles to the railroad with barbed wire on
each side so that a motor train couldn’t rush
through. “You can’t go into the front line
trenches,” the commanding officer told me.
“Nobody is allowed in there except military
men, but you can go through the opening in
the barbed wire and start across.” That was
the best I could do, so the lieutenant took
me around those barbed wires and down into
a ditch at the edge of the railroad and pointed
to me to climb the bank. Well, I climbed up
somehow, it was about twenty-five feet; and
started down that track with my big suitcase
and a heavy overcoat on, holding up my umbrella
with a white handkerchief tied to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a very hot day and I had to walk
two miles across the neutral zone—two miles
right straight down the tracks. You could
see the Bolshevist trenches in the distance.
Pretty soon the firing started. I couldn’t feel
anything dropping near me, so I decided those
Lettish soldiers were popping their heads out
of the trenches to see this fool go across and
the Bolshevists were taking pot shots at
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Lettish officer had told me: “If they
start to fire on you, roll off down the bank
and crawl back to our positions.” But I
would have had to roll twenty-five feet and
probably crawl a mile. So I kept on. A scattering
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>rifle fire spat out from the Red trenches
and the shells screamed steadily overhead. My
suitcase dragged heavily and I was uncomfortably
warm, but I made good progress. I had
covered about half the distance when a rifle
bullet whipped by my ear. I plunged along
the track with redoubled speed.</p>

<p class='c000'>As I came within fifty yards of the barbed
wire which the Russians had strung across
the tracks, Red soldiers shouted up at me
from their trenches and motioned for me to
come down into the adjoining field where
there was a gap in the wire. A few moments
later I was in the first-line trench of the Red
army.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was hot and exhausted and still resentful
of that shot. I spoke first: “Why did you
shoot at me?” They did not understand, but
one of them evidently knew I was speaking
English. He called down the trench to another
soldier who ran up. He was a tall
young Slav, and showed white teeth in a
broad smile as he greeted me in good English.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hello, America,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why did you shoot at me?” I repeated indignantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh,” he made a deprecatory gesture.</p>

<p class='c000'>“One of the comrades made a mistake,” he
said. “He shot at you without orders. But
you also made a mistake.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What was that?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You carried a white flag,” he said, grinning.
“It should have been red.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
  <h2 id='chap02' class='c005'>CHAPTER II <br /> WITH THE RED SOLDIERS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>I asked to be taken to the commanding
officer and two soldiers were detailed to
escort me. One of the “comrades” laid down
his rifle and picking up my suitcase led the
way down the trenches; the other shouldered
his rifle and followed close behind me. I
kept my eye on the suitcase and trudged
along.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were both very friendly, and with a
great show of their English began talking to
me at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you know,” said one of them, “that
the dock workers are on strike in New
York?” And while I was still wondering to
myself how Russia, shut off from all the rest
of the world, could have heard this piece of
news, the other “comrade” burst out:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Who is going to win the pennant in the
National League?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Where do you learn these things?” I
asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“From the bulletins,” he replied briefly.
I learned later that the wireless at Moscow
works twenty-four hours a day, and that it
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>grabs from the air practically all the news
that is wirelessed from America to European
countries. Each morning in Moscow bulletins
carrying this information are printed
and distributed in the industries, in the
peasant villages and among soldiers.</p>

<p class='c000'>For three versts we walked along the railroad
track, and at last reached the headquarters
at Levenhoff. I was taken to the
commanding officer, who spoke English fairly
well.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you want here?” he asked looking
me over keenly.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had expected that question and had my
answer ready. I knew I would have to give
an explanation, but what I did not know was
that I would have to give that explanation
over and over again all the way from Levenhoff
to Moscow.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I came to look you over,” I said. “In the
world outside there are many conflicting
stories about Soviet Russia and I want to
see for myself what is going on here. I am
not a spy. I should like to be allowed to go
to Petrograd and Moscow and to travel
through the country and then return to America
and tell what I have seen.”</p>

<p>RED ARMY’S INFANTRY DIVISION<br /><span class='small'>Parading on the Famous Hodinskoe Polie in Moscow.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The Red officer took a long look at me and
turned to a telephone. I knew just enough
Russian at that time to get the drift of his
conversation. He called up the Brigade headquarters
and reported that an “Amerikanski”
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>journalist had come across the lines and
wanted to proceed into the country. There
was much conversation while I stood waiting
nervously. Presently he hung up the receiver
and turning to me said, “You will have to
report to the Brigade Command at Praele.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And is there a train?” I asked when I
learned that I had twenty-two more versts to
go to Praele. There was not; I must drive
there in a droshky. It would be ready for
me in a few minutes. And the officer gave
some orders. Presently the droshky arrived
and a great powerful Red Guard with a rifle
slung over his shoulder motioned to me to
get in. He climbed in after me and we drove
off.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was early evening by now. Vast
stretches of country swept away from us on
either side of the road. I tried to talk to
my burly guard, but his English was as
meager as my Russian. Our conversation
resolved itself into wild gestures and signs.
The night was clear, brightly moonlit, and
about nine o’clock it grew very cold. The
chill crept into every crevice of my clothing
and penetrated to my very bones, and I lost
all interest in the country around us.</p>

<p class='c000'>For hours we seemed to drive through the
chill and dampness. I was fairly frozen
when I realized that the guard suddenly took
off his coat and silently offered it to me. I
refused to take it, of course, thanking him—“Spasiba,
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>Tovarishch!” I said. He chuckled
at my Russian and repeated Tovarishch, the
Russian word for comrade.</p>

<p class='c000'>We reached Praele at midnight. My guard
took a receipt for me from the commanding
officer as though I were a bundle of clothes
or a package of groceries, and returned to
Levenhoff....</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you want here?”</p>

<p class='c000'>I delivered my speech of explanation.
The next question was welcome. “Would
you like something to eat before you sleep?”
I was very hungry. The officer called a soldier
who went out and returned with some
black bread and tea, with apple sauce. When
I had finished eating, my guard took me to
a large barrack room where about thirty soldiers
were sleeping in their uniforms on
wooden bunks built in around the walls.
Several of them woke when we came in and
looked me over with interest. They passed
cigarettes and apples. We smoked and
munched for awhile together, and presently
every one settled down to sleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>I awoke about nine the next morning. The
soldiers were all up and gone. A guard came
in and led me to a building across the street
where three officers and two privates were
breakfasting together. A pleasant-faced
Russian woman presided over the stove. A
place was made for me at the table and I
was served with a very unsavory coffee-colored
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>liquid, one egg, a small piece of butter,
and plenty of black bread. While we ate a
young Russian boy about thirteen years old
played the violin,—the <cite>Internationale</cite>, the
<cite>Marseillaise</cite>, and some charming folk-songs.</p>

<p class='c000'>We returned to the barracks after breakfast
and a little later the Commissar attached
to brigade headquarters came in to
see me. He could not speak English, so we
carried on our conversation through the Commandant.
First of all he asked what I wanted
in Soviet Russia. I went through my patter
and they left me. For half an hour I sat
wondering what would happen next. Then
the Commandant returned.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We believe you are telling the truth,” he
said. “We are glad to have people come in
from the outside to learn what we are doing
and what we hope to do under Soviet rule.
But some whom we have allowed to come in
have gone out and told outrageous lies about
our country and our people; others have
come across our lines and have gone away and
revealed our military positions to the enemy.
We are defending ourselves and must be
careful. You must pass on to the Division
Command at Rejistza, thence to Army
Headquarters, and finally to the High Command
for investigation. After that you will
be allowed to remain in Soviet Russia—or
you will be deported.”</p>

<p class='c000'>That evening I was taken under guard
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>across country to a small railway station
where we caught a train which brought us
to Rejistza at four o’clock in the morning.
A bed was found for me in the station master’s
house. At eight o’clock my guard
woke me and dragged me off to the Commissar
and the military Commandant at Division
Headquarters, turned me over to them
and took a receipt for me delivered in good
order.</p>

<p class='c000'>After breakfast of black bread and tea
came the question, “What do you want
here?” I was told that I would have to wait
till the following day for a decision on my
case. Meanwhile I could walk about and see
the town. The Commandant filled out a slip
of paper which he told me I was to show to
any one who offered to interfere with my
stroll.</p>

<p class='c000'>I found Rejistza a fair-sized town. The
people were going about their business in
normal fashion. They appeared to be in good
health and they were all well clothed. Many
of the shops were closed for lack of wares;
others were open, though none seemed to have
much stock. There was, however, an abundance
of fruit in the stalls, and some vegetables.
The streets were dirty. Carpenters
were at work on some of the houses, many
of which were badly out of repair.</p>

<p class='c000'>I began looking for some one who could
speak English, and soon discovered a young
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>Russian boy who was eager to talk about his
town.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But why are your streets so dirty?” I
asked him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Rejistza always was a dirty town,
but we are cleaning it up now as fast as
possible,” he added with civic pride that was
obviously newly acquired.</p>

<p class='c000'>The streets were full of sturdy, well-clad
soldiers moving through to the Dvinsk front
where the Reds were bringing up reinforcements
to stop the Polish offensive. Bands
were playing and the soldiers marched by in
good order, with heads erect, singing the
<cite>Internationale</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>I walked down towards the river Dvina.
The sun was shining, the air crisply cold.
A crowd of children came bounding out of
a school-house and scampered towards a large
park to enjoy their recess hour. They ran
about playing games much as children in this
country do. One group quickly marked out
a space on the sidewalk with chalk and began
skipping and hopping in and put among the
chalked squares. Others played tag and still
others played hiding games. They were all
busy. The teachers had come out into the
park with the children, and for an hour children
and teachers alike played and talked together
in the sunlight. Here or there sat a
teacher on a park bench surrounded by a
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>crowd of alert children who hung upon every
word as she related Russian fairy tales.</p>

<p class='c000'>And when the hour was over every one
trooped back into the school-room with as
much ardor as when they came out into the
park. I wandered over to the river, but soon
returned to the school-house. I wanted to
find out what a Russian school-room was like.</p>

<p class='c000'>I slipped in through the door and took a
seat near by. No one took notice of me. The
teacher continued her talking and the children
listened with as much interest as they
had outside when she was telling them of the
wonderful deeds of the heroes of folk-lore.
For an hour I sat and listened and then
walked away still unnoticed. I returned
through the town to the Commissar’s house
quite unmolested.</p>

<p class='c000'>That day I dined with the Commissar and
four or five of his staff. I had looked forward
to the meal all day, and was grateful
when at last we sat down to table. Cabbage
soup and a small piece of fish were served to
each of us. The others talked a great deal;
I waited for more food, but none came, and
I went to bed that night with a great gnawing
inside of me.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was awakened at four o’clock in the
morning by a new guard who led me off to a
train. The decision had been made, as the
Commandant had promised it would be. The
train was bound for Velikie Luki. The new
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>guard and I had breakfast on board—black
bread and two apples.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was four in the afternoon when we
reached our destination. A droshky carried
us five versts to the headquarters of the 15th
Army, where I was again delivered into the
hands of a Commissar.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wearily I repeated my lines, thinking
much more about the possibility of getting a
meal from this Commissar than I did about
getting a pass into Moscow. I must have
looked as hungry and tired as I felt, for the
Commissar instead of granting the pass took
me to his home, which was only a short way
down the street.</p>

<p class='c000'>His house seemed to me to be the most
comfortable place I had ever seen. I was introduced
to his wife, who came to meet us at
the door. Two children soon appeared and
then the Commissar’s mother, and at once we
began talking like old friends. I was taken
to a cheerful room where I dusted and washed
myself, and when I returned to the others
the evening meal was set forth on the table.
It seemed almost bountiful to me after the
meager portions of cabbage soup and black
bread I had been eating for the past few
days. Actually it was only cabbage soup
again, one fish ball for each, some kasha, black
bread and tea. I ate ravenously, and I am
afraid I gave my host and hostess the impression
that I was a glutton.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>I went to bed early that night feeling well
fed for the first time in days. In the morning
I set forth early for headquarters with the
Commissar and there was turned over to a
guard, who took me out to show me Velikie
Luki.</p>

<p class='c000'>The town was crowded with soldiers strolling
idly along the streets, soldiers marching
briskly to the railroad station, soldiers falling
in and out of barracks, soldiers everywhere,—and
singing, always singing, with bands and
without, ceaselessly singing their beloved <cite>Internationale</cite>.
The troops were moving out to
the Dvinsk and Denikin fronts. The thoroughfares
were crowded with civilians watching
the regiments pass by—men, women, and
children, shouting, waving caps and handkerchiefs,
and joining in the chorus of the

<p>TROTZKY<br />Commissar of War and Marine</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I followed the marching lines to the railway
station. Trains were pulling out and
empty cars moving in as fast as they could
be loaded. And how they were loaded! Passenger
cars, box cars, flat cars, jammed with
shouting, laughing soldiers, waving good-bye,
joking and singing. Every inch of space
carried a soldier. Platforms, steps, roofs,
and even the engines were covered with
scrambling, good-natured Reds. A train
already filled drew in and emptied a load of
men back from the front for a rest. The
wounded were carried off carefully. From
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>the end of the train a detachment of about
two hundred disarmed soldiers marched up
the platform under guard. These were the
first prisoners I had encountered, and I was
anxious to see what would be done with them.
They marched away from the station and I
asked my guard if we might follow them. He
made no objection. The townspeople paid no
attention to the prisoners. Evidently they
were an accustomed sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>They went about a mile down a long side
street, parallel to the railroad, and then
turned abruptly across lots and entered a
large barrack. A sentry was posted outside,
but after a little explanation my guard obtained
permission for us to go in. The prisoners
were seated on the floor, with their
backs to the wall. Two soldiers brought in
steaming samovars through a side door and
others carried in great loaves of bread. Tea
was made and handed around to the prisoners
and the bread was cut in large chunks
and given to them. The captives ate hungrily,
their guards chatting and laughing
with them. While they were still eating, two
more Red soldiers entered, with bundles of
printed pamphlets, which they distributed
among the prisoners, who ate, drank, and
read.</p>

<p class='c000'>If there was a German soldier there, he
received German literature; if a Lithuanian,
he received Lithuanian literature; if he happened
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>to be French—well, they had it in all
languages. All the while they were holding
the prisoners they fed them three times a
day, sometimes bread and tea and sometimes
cabbage soup, <em>and they kept them reading all
the time</em>; when they were not reading some
of the Commissars were in there talking with
them, telling them about the world, and what
the war was about and why they were sent
there. They had the organization of it perfected
to such an extent that prisoners were
not there five minutes before they were eating,
and they were not eating five minutes
before they were reading.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bolshevist warfare does not end with the
taking of prisoners. The propaganda follows.
The Soviet leaders think more of it
than they do of bullets. They say it is more
effective. Three times on the western front
I witnessed this same scene where prisoners
were brought in.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Russia they like very much to take
prisoners. The only objection is that they
haven’t got much food and they don’t like
to starve them. They told me that they would
like to take a million prisoners a day, if they
had plenty of food and paper. After all,
the biggest war they were carrying on in
Russia was a war of education. All along
the battle-front you could see streamers telling
the other side what the thing was about—you
could read them a hundred yards away.
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>At night they put two posts in the ground
and fastened the streamer between them. In
the morning, when the sun rose, there it was.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the two days I spent in Velikie
Luki, and later at many other places along
the front, I sought every opportunity to
study the Red army. I am not an expert
and cannot report upon the technical details
of military equipment. There seemed no lack
of small arms or cannon. In general the soldiers
were warmly clad and strongly shod.
Certainly they were in good spirits. The relations
between officers and men were interesting.
There was no lack of discipline. Off
duty all ranks mingled as comrades, men
and officers joking, laughing, singing, or
talking seriously together. Under orders the
men obeyed promptly. I found it the same
at the front, in the barracks, and at headquarters
with the Commissars and highest officers.
When there was no serious work
to be done they associated without distinction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wherever I met the Red soldiers I was
struck with this combination of comradeship
and discipline. On more than one occasion
I have gone into a commandant’s office along
the front, at some high command, and found
him playing cards or checkers with his men.
Privates and under-officers would crowd in
unceremoniously and engage in voluble chatter
without the slightest indication of superiority
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>or deference to rank. Then, suddenly,
perhaps a ring on the telephone, and the
commander would receive a report of some
development along the front. A brisk order
would bring the room to attentive silence;
cards and checkerboards and fiddles would
be shoved aside. The men would file out to
their posts. They seemed to have an instant
appreciation of the distinction between comradeship
in the barracks and discipline on
duty.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>THE RED ARMY</h3>

<p class='c018'>The ordinary Red soldier gets 400 rubles
a month, with rations and clothes. Soviet
officials told me that there were 2,000,000
thoroughly trained and equipped men in the
fighting forces, with another million in reserve
and under training. About 50,000
young officers, they said, chosen from the
most capable peasants and workers, had
already graduated from the officers’ training
schools under the Soviet Government. Thousands
of others had been developed from the
ranks.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is easy for the casual observer to misjudge
that subtle and all-important element
known as “morale.” I think that I am perhaps
more than ordinarily skeptical of manifestations
of patriotic fervor, knowing something
of the means by which every general
staff keeps up the fighting spirit of the
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>ranks. But I retain from my contact with
the Red soldiers a sense of peculiar zeal and
dogged grit. Certainly they do not want to
fight. They want to go home and settle
down in peace. But this frankly confessed
distaste for slaughter seems only to emphasize
their determination to see the struggle
through to the end. For all their war weariness
they did not act like men driven unwillingly
into battle. I tried to imagine myself
enduring what many of them have endured
for over five years, betrayed by their
first leaders, overwhelmingly defeated by
their first enemy, and still struggling on
against new assaults from those they had been
taught to believe were their friends and
allies.</p>

<p class='c000'>I tried to imagine what vast process of
propaganda could have stimulated this unyielding
endurance. Propaganda there undoubtedly
was. Just as the Allied armies had
their attendant organizations of welfare
workers and entertainers to keep up the
morale, so the Red Army was accompanied by
a carefully organized system of revolutionary
propaganda. I suppose the American
soldier would not have fought so well had
he not been constantly reminded that he was
fighting to make the world safe for Democracy.
The Red soldier is persuaded that
he fights to keep Russia safe for the Revolution.
This ideal is deeply personal. He
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>feels it is his revolution; he feels that he
accomplished it regardless of his leaders,
certainly in spite of some of them; and now
it is his to defend against attacks from without
and within. In judging this thing I find
myself turning away from generalizations
and disregarding what I was told by those
enthusiasts who have the Red Army in their
keeping. I come back again and again to
the men themselves. Before I left Russia I
had seen a great many soldiers. I had lived
with them, traveled with them, slept in their
barracks, eaten in their mess. To the American
of course, the conditions under which
the European masses manage to maintain
existence, even in normal times, is always a
matter of surprise and wonder. The Soviet
Government does everything possible for the
Red Army. It is their constant thought and
care. But the utmost that can be provided,
even of bare subsistence, seems painfully
inadequate to the westerner.</p>

<p class='c000'>The preferential treatment of the soldiers,
of which I had heard so much before I saw
it and shared it, consists principally in maintaining
an uninterrupted supply of black
bread and tea. It may be propaganda, it
may be a peculiar quality in the spiritual
and physical composition of the Russian
peasant. Whatever it is, I do not believe
that any other European army would endure
so long on a ration of black bread and tea.
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>An occasional apple or cigarette were luxuries,
all too quickly consumed and forgotten.
The black bread and tea, constant and unvaried,
will ever remain for me the symbol
both of the efficiency of the Soviet Commissary
and of the zeal of the Red soldier. Black
bread and tea and song. Their love for song
is amazing,—all songs, but principally the
<cite>Internationale</cite>. They march off to the front
singing, they limp back from battle singing,
they sing on the trains, and in the barracks,
and at mess; they sing while they are playing
checkers and they sing while they are
sweeping stables. They wake up at night
and sing. I have heard them do it.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was told that about seventy-five percent of
the Czar’s officers were in the Soviet Army.
This was no sign that they were converted to
communism. Their spirit remained essentially
patriotic. They supported the Soviet
Government, not because it was a Socialist
government, but because it was <em>the</em> government.
They fought to defend Russia.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was Trotzky who insisted on allowing
these old officers to come into the army.
Many of the Communists thought they would
betray the soldiers on the front and turn them
over to the enemy. But Trotzky said it was
a question of permitting the experienced officers
to train the men and teach them military
tactics or the Red Army would be destroyed.
Trotzky had his way. At every army post,
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>whether it was a company, a brigade, a regiment
or a division, wherever there was an
old army officer there was a trusted Commissar
who worked in the office, and every move
the old army officer made was known to the
Commissar.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following manifesto, drawn up and
signed by 137 officers of the old régime, appealing
to their former messmates to quit the
counter-revolution and stop making war upon
the Soviet Government, which the people had
established and would defend against all attacks,
was sent through the Denikin lines:</p>

<p class='c019'>"Officers—Comrades:</p>

<p class='c019'>"We address this letter to you with the intention
of avoiding useless and aimless shedding of blood. We
know quite well that the army of General Denikin will
be crushed, as was that of Kolchak and of many
others who have tried to put at their mercy a working
people of many millions of men. We know equally
well that truth and justice are on the side of the Red
Army, and that you only remain in the ranks of the
White Army through ignorance regarding the Soviet
Republic and the Red Army, or because you fear for
your fate in case of the latter’s victory. We think
it our duty above all to write you the truth about the
position made for us in the Red Army. First we guarantee
to you that no officers of the White Army passing
over into our camp are shot. That is the order
of the Supreme Revolutionary Council of War.</p>

<p>LENIN AND MRS. LENIN, MOSCOW, 1919</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>"If you come with the simple desire to lessen the
sufferings of the working population, to lessen the
shedding of blood, nobody will touch you. As to
officers who express the desire to serve loyally in the
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>Red Army they are received with respect and extreme
courtesy. We have not to submit to any kind of outrage
or humiliation. Everywhere our needs are attentively
supplied. Full respect for the work of specialists
of every kind is the fundamental motive of the
policy of the present government and of its authorized
representatives in the Red Army. Quite unlike the
practice in the old army, you are not asked, ‘Who are
your parents?’ but only one thing—‘Are you loyal?’
A loyal officer who is educated and who works advances
rapidly on the ladder of military administration,
is received everywhere with respect, attention,
and kindness. Among the troops an exemplary discipline
has been introduced.</p>

<p class='c019'>“From the material point of view we could not be
better treated. As for the Commissars, in the vast
majority of cases we work hand in hand with them,
and in case of disagreement the most highly authorized
representatives of the power of the Soviets take rapidly
decisive measures for getting rid of the differences.
In a word, the longer we serve in the Red Army, the
more we are convinced that service is not a burden to
us. Many of us began to serve with a little sinking of
the heart, solely to earn a living, but the longer our
service has lasted the more we are convinced of the
possibility of loyal and conscientious service in this
army. That is why, officer comrades, we allow ourselves
to call you such although we know that the word
‘comrade’ is considered insulting among you, because
among us it indicates relations of simple cordiality
and mutual respect. Without proposing that you
should make any decision, we beg you to examine the
question, and in your future conduct to take account
of our evidence. We wish to say one thing more,—we
congratulate ourselves that in fulfilling obligations
loyally we are not the servants of any foreign government.
We are glad to serve neither German imperialism,
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>nor the imperialism which is Anglo-Franco-American.
We do what our conscience dictates to us in
the interest of millions and millions of workers, to
which number the vast majority of the company of the
officers belong.”</p>

  <h2 id='chap03' class='c005'>CHAPTER III <br /> ON TO MOSCOW</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Before leaving Velikie Luki I wandered
with my guard down a street of
the town and came upon a Soviet bookstore.
Inside were thousands of books and pamphlets,
in what seemed to me all the languages
of the world. The store was full of men and
women buying these books and pamphlets. I
learned that this store and many others like
it had been opened almost two years before,
and that knowledge of history and social
conditions throughout the world was thus being
brought to millions of Russians formerly
held in darkness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Later in the afternoon of that day the
Commissar informed me that I was free to
go on to Smolensk and that if I passed muster
there I could go anywhere I desired in
Russia. I was given another guard, a big
fellow who had spent ten years in England
and returned to Russia when the Czar was
overthrown. He so much resembled the
Irish labor leader, Jim Larkin, that I called
him “Larkin” throughout the course of our
journey together.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had an exclamation which he used frequently
when I was too pertinacious to suit
him.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>“God love a duck, what do you want now?”
he would roar with a despairing gesture, and
the tone of his voice also was despairing. It
may be that he was justified in his complaint,
for there was much that I wanted to know
and to see.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the last day of our journey towards
Moscow he turned to me and said, “I haven’t
prayed for ten years or more,—not since I
was down and out in Glasgow, Scotland, and
wandered into a Salvation Army headquarters.
Then I did go down on my knees and
pray for help, but I decided since that praying
wasn’t my job. But God love a duck,
when I get you safely into Moscow I’m going
down on my knees again and thank God that
this job is over and ask Him to save me from
any more Americans of your kind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But there was, after all, some excuse for
my troubling him so often and so much.
“Larkin” slept on every possible—and impossible—occasion,
and the sound of his
snores, with which I can think of nothing
worthy of comparison, kept me awake, so
that in self-defence I used to rouse him every
time we reached a station to ask questions
about where we were and why we had stopped
there and what the people were doing and
why they were doing it. When I had him
sufficiently awake to begin to smoke I could
snatch a bit of sleep for myself, for he invariably
sat up until he had smoked eight or
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>ten cigarettes, after which his snoring began
again and my rest ended.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Larkin’s” real name was August Grafman,
which sounded Teutonic. He was
a Russian Jew, however, and a good fellow.
I hope to see him again sometime, and I commend
him to any other Americans who want
to see for themselves what is going on in Russia
at the present time. He spoke English
readily and perfectly, and from him I obtained
much information I might otherwise
have missed. There was the time when
we waited for a train at a small station
in the course of our journey towards Smolensk.
All at once a commotion arose on
the other side of the station. Hurrying
around, we saw a man running, pursued by
three or four Red soldiers. Two officers coming
toward the station drew their sabres and
held them before the man, who stopped and
his pursuers captured him. They brought
him back to the station and I observed that
he was a Jew. I wondered if his crime was
that of his race, remembering stories of pogroms.
The Jew was brought into the station
and seated on a bench. Immediately
the soldiers surrounded him, and one of them
stood up in front of him and made a long
speech. At its conclusion he sat down, and
another rose and made an address. Finally
a third vociferously questioned the man. At
last the Jew arose, the soldiers made way for
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>him, and he left the station. “Larkin” who
had been too much interested in the proceedings
to talk to me, now satisfied my curiosity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Jew had been caught in the act of
picking the pockets of a soldier. Furthermore
it was his third offence. The first man
who spoke had tried to impress the Jew with
the enormity of the crime of robbing a man
who was on his way to defend his country.
He had said, “Don’t you realize that a man
going out to fight carries nothing with him
except what he actually needs, whether it be
money or anything else, and that it is worse
to rob a soldier on this account than an ordinary
civilian, with a home, and all his treasures
about him?” The second man had
talked of the defence of the country; the
soldiers were going to fight so that when the
fighting ended there would be enough for
every one and no need for stealing. The third
had tried to obtain a promise that the man
would not again steal from soldiers. He had
been successful, and, “now the Jew is free,”
said Larkin.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But it was his third offense,” I said. “I
should think they would punish him severely.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Larkin” gave me a pitying glance. “You
don’t understand the Russians,” he said
simply. “They are kind and in their own
new born freedom they want every one to be
free.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>At last our train arrived and we got on.
To Smolensk and then to Moscow, I thought.
But it was not so simple as that. Our train
was going to Moghilev direct, so we had to
get off again at Polotsk at nine in the evening,
where we found that we were half an
hour too late to catch the train for Smolensk.
“Larkin” hunted around for a sleeping place
for us when we learned that we would have
to stay overnight in the town, and finally won
the favor of the Commissar, who took us
to what he called the “Trainmen’s Hotel,”
a large building near the station. In the
room into which we were ushered there were
about twenty beds, the linen on which was
far from clean. Two of the beds in one corner
of the room were assigned to us and we
lay down fully dressed. After what seemed
a few minutes I was awakened by a vigorous
kick, and found a huge Russian standing
over me, brandishing his arms and speaking
harshly and menacingly at me. I hurriedly
shook “Larkin” out of his profound slumber,
and at the end of a brief but spirited discussion
between the two in Russian, he informed
me that the man had been working all night
in the railroad shop and had come in to sleep.
He resented finding his bed occupied. I suspected
“Larkin” of enjoying the joke on me,
as I clambered out and shivered in the cold,
but his enjoyment was brief, for he was
almost immediately ordered out by another
man who entered and claimed his bed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>The two of us wandered out forlornly into
the cold foggy morning and went back to the
station. The Commissar there made us comfortable
in his office until daylight, when we
went down the track to a water tank and had
a “hobo wash” after which we ate our breakfast—one
egg each, black bread and tea, in
the Soviet restaurant in the station.</p>

<p class='c000'>We had been told that we could not get
a train to Smolensk before four o’clock in the
afternoon, but at eleven the Commissar
told us that a trainload of soldiers going to
the Denikin front would be passing through
at two in the afternoon and that it might be
possible to arrange for our transportation on
this train, if we wished it. We did wish
it and at two o’clock we were in a box
car full of soldiers en route to Smolensk,
which we would reach at ten that night.</p>

<p class='c000'>The soldiers sang all evening—Russian soldiers
always sing, no matter how crowded, how
hungry, or how weary—but one by one they
dropped off to sleep, huddled up in all sorts
of positions. The train jolted along, slowly,
it seemed to me, and it was too dark to see
anything through the window. My guard
went to sleep, and I remember thinking we
must be near Smolensk and that I would have
to stay awake since he seemed to find his responsibilities
resting lightly. The stopping
of the train roused me, and thinking that we
had arrived at Smolensk I shook “Larkin”
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>who looked at his watch and exclaimed,
“Why it’s midnight. We must have passed
Smolensk.”</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>LENIN IN THE COURTYARD OF THE KREMLIN, MOSCOW,  SUMMER OF 1919</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Surely enough, we had gone through
Smolensk and were seventy five versts on the
other side of it, bound for the Denikin front.
I had no objections to going there eventually
but I preferred to have permission first, so
we hastily bundled out of the train and went
into the station. “Larkin” approached the
door of the Commissar’s office and tried to
brush past the Red Guard who sat there, and
who objected to such an unceremonious entrance.
After an interminable discussion—perhaps
five minutes,—I said, “He wants to
see your credentials. Why don’t you show
them to him? Do you want us both to be
arrested?”</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Red guard had lost patience by
this time. A snap of his fingers brought a
policeman who arrested “Larkin” and before
I had finished the “I told you so,” I could
not restrain, I found the heavy hand of the
law on my own shoulder. The two of us were
marched down the street and locked in a little
dark room in what was apparently the
town jail.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the two hours of solitude that followed
I shared all my dismal forebodings with that
unfortunate guard. We would be taken for
spies and as spies we would certainly be shot.
I couldn’t be sorry that this penalty would
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>be inflicted upon anyone so stupid and obstinate
and generally asinine as he, but I at
least wanted to get back to America and tell
people how stupid a big Russian could be.
There were probably some adjectives also,
I am not sure that he listened. In any event
I could not see the signs of contrition that
might at least have lightened my apprehensions.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the end of two hours two Red soldiers
opened the door of our cell and escorted us
to the police station where we were taken at
once before the judge, a simple, but very
determined looking peasant, who examined
first the Red Guard who had caused our arrest,
the policeman who had arrested us, and
two soldiers who had witnessed the affair.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Larkin” in the meantime very reluctantly
interpreted whatever comments and explanations
I had to make. He became more and
more stubborn and taciturn. The Red Guard
told his story, which was verified by the policeman.
The two soldiers further attested to
the truth of the tale and stated that we had
been entirely at fault. Then the judge asked
my guard for an explanation, and with the
air of one playing a forgotten ace which
would take trick and game, “Larkin” produced
our credentials and laid them triumphantly
on the judge’s desk.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he had read them the judge rose
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>and made a statement which I demanded my
guard should translate.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh he is just saying,” said “Larkin,”
“to please tell the American that we are
sorry this thing happened. We are only
working people and we must be careful to
guard our country. The Red Guard at the
door was simply obeying orders and doing
his duty, and we want the American to understand
that no deliberate offence was intended.
There are so many people making
war on us, both inside and outside, and we
have to be careful.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When “Larkin” had translated my reply,
which was to the effect that we acknowledged
our fault, and had only congratulations for
the men who understood their duty and had
the courage to perform it, and that I regretted
having been the cause of so much trouble,
the judge himself led us to a first-class
train coach in the yards, unlocked it, and told
us to enter and spend the rest of the night
there.</p>

<p class='c000'>“At eight o’clock in the morning this coach
will be picked up by the train to Smolensk.
Now, go to sleep, you won’t have to be on
the watch this time,” he said with a suggestion
of a smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>Weary as I was I still remembered a few
more things to say to “Larkin” who was by
this time somewhat subdued. It was not until
I had threatened to report him to the Moscow
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>Government, and had again told him that
it was a brutal thing to take advantage of
men who were doing their duty under the
most difficult circumstances conceivable, that
my mind was lightened sufficiently so that I
could go to sleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of one thing I had been convinced—the
general efficiency of organization which I had
encountered again and again in Soviet Russia.
The people were universally kind, but
with strangers they took no chances. Well,
I concluded, they could not have been blamed
if they had kept us in jail for a long while,
until they had checked up my entire record
in Russia, at least. And I was grateful that
my prison record amounted to two hours
only, thanks to the expedition with which
they administer trial to suspects in Red
Russia.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shut up in our coach we sped on to
Smolensk the next day. Another twenty-four
hours in Smolensk, where I was given permission
to proceed to Moscow and again I
boarded a train. I had been relayed from one
army post to another; from the company to
the regiment, from the regiment to the
brigade, from the brigade to the division,
from the division to the army command, and
from the army command to the high command.
And after eight days I was almost
within reach of Moscow. On the morrow I
would be off for Moscow itself.</p>

<p class='c014'>I reached Moscow on Sunday afternoon
and was taken at once by “Larkin” to the
Foreign Office at the Metropole hotel. As
we drove through the picturesque town of
many churches we passed great numbers of
people enjoying the sunshine. The parks and
squares were full of romping children.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Foreign Office I was greeted by Litvinoff,
who gave me credentials which granted
me freedom of action—freedom to go where
I pleased and without a guard as long as I
remained in Soviet Russia; and Communist
life began for me.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Metropole hotel, like all others in
Soviet Russia, had been taken over by the
Government. The rooms not occupied by the
Foreign Office were used as living rooms by
Government employees. The National hotel is
used entirely for Soviet workers, and the
beautiful residence in which Mirbach, the
German ambassador, was assassinated is now
the headquarters of the Third International.</p>

<p class='c000'>No one was allowed to have more than one
meal a day. This consisted of cabbage soup,
a small piece of fish and black bread, and was
served at Soviet restaurants at any time
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>between one o’clock in the afternoon and
seven at night. There were a few old
cafés still in existence, run by private
speculators, where it was possible to purchase
a piece of meat at times, but the prices were
exorbitant. In the Soviet restaurants ten
rubles was charged for the meal, while in the
cafés the same kind of meal would have cost
from 100 to 150 rubles.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Soviet restaurants had been established
everywhere, in villages and small towns
as well as in cities. In the villages and railway
stations they were usually in the station
building itself or near it. In the cities they
were scattered everywhere, so as to be easily
accessible to the workers. Some of them were
run on the cafeteria plan; in others women
carried the food to the tables for the other
workers. One entered, showed his credentials
to prove that he was a worker and was given
a meal check, for which he paid a fixed sum.
Needless to say, there was no tipping. I had
not the courage to experiment by offering a
tip to these dignified, self-respecting women.
I think they would have laughed at my
“stupid foreign ways” had I done so.</p>

<p class='c000'>The old café life of Moscow was a thing of
the past. If you wished anything to eat at
night you had to purchase bread and tea
earlier in the day and make tea in your room.
This was very simple because the kitchens in
hotels were used exclusively for heating
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>water. At breakfast time and all through the
evening a stream of people went to the
kitchen with pails and pitchers for hot water
which they carried to their rooms themselves
where they made their tea and munched black
bread. There were no maids or bell boys to
do these errands for you, and the only service
you got in a hotel was that of a maid
who cleaned your room each morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>The working people would buy a pound or
two of black bread in the evening on their
way home. They had their samovars on
which they made tea, and if they felt so
inclined ate in the evening. For breakfast
they again had tea and black bread like every
one else. As a result of this diet hundreds
of thousands of people were suffering from
malnutrition. The bulk of the people in the
city were hungry all the time.</p>

<p class='c000'>I found the tramway service,—reduced
fifty percent because of the lack of fuel,—miserably
inadequate for the needs of the
population which had greatly increased since
Moscow became the capital. The citizens in
their necessity have developed the most extraordinary
propensities in step-clinging.
They swarm on the platforms and stand on
one another’s feet with the greatest good nature,
and then, when there isn’t room to
wedge in another boot, the late-comers cling
to the bodies of those who have been lucky
enough to get a foothold, and still others
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>cling to these, until the overhanging mass
reaches half-way to the curb. I tried it once
myself—and walked thereafter. There were
not many automobiles to be seen. The Government
had requisitioned all cars. The motors
were run by coal oil and alcohol, and the
Government had very little of these.</p>

<p class='c000'>During my second day in Moscow I met
some English prisoners walking quite freely
in the streets. I went up to a group of three
and told them I was an American, and asked
how they were getting on. They said they
wanted to go home because the food was
scarce, but aside from the lack of food they
had nothing to complain of.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course food is scarce,” said one, “but
we get just as much as anyone else. Nobody
gets much. You see us walking about the
streets. No one is following us. We are
free to go where we please. They send us
to the theatre three nights a week. We go
to the opera and the ballet. That’s what they
do with all prisoners.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Another broke in enthusiastically to say
that if there were only food enough he would
be glad to stay in Russia. Several of their
pals, they told me, were working in Soviet
offices.</p>

<p class='c000'>They belonged to a detachment of ninety
English who had been captured six months
before, on the Archangel front. Before they
went into action, they said, their commanding
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>officer told each one to carry a hand grenade
in his pocket, and if taken prisoner to blow
off his head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Bolsheviki,” he told us, "would torture
us—first they would cut off a finger, then
an ear, then the tip of the nose, and they
would keep stripping us and torturing us
until we died twenty-one days later.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, before we knew it the Bolsheviki
had us surrounded. There was nothing to
do but surrender—and none of us used his
bomb. The Bolsheviks marched us back
about ten miles to a barrack, where we were
told to sit down. Pretty soon they brought
in a samovar and gave us tea and bread, and
when we were about half through eating they
brought in bundles of pamphlets. The pamphlets
were all printed in English, mind you,
and they told us why we had been sent to
Russia.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I recognized in his description the thing
I had seen myself on the Western Front a few
days before. I asked him if that was the
usual way of treating prisoners.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” he said, “that’s the way they do
it. They don’t kill you. They just feed you
with tea and bread, and this—what they call
on the outside ‘propaganda’ and they say to
you, ‘you read this stuff for a week,’ and you
do, and you believe it—you can’t help it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was bitterly cold in Moscow, though the
Bolshevists made light of the September
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>weather and laughed at my complaints. “Stay
the winter with us,” they said, “and you
will learn what cold is.” The city was practically
without heat. The chill and damp entered
my bones and pursued me through the
streets and into my bed at night. One can
stand prolonged exposure and cold if there
is only the sustaining thought of a glowing
fire somewhere, and a warm bed. But in
Moscow there was no respite from the relentless
chill. One was cold all day and all night.
The aching pinch of it tore at the nerves. I
marvelled at the endurance of the undernourished
clerks and officials in the great
damp Government office buildings, where it
was often colder than in the dry sunshine
outside.</p>

<p class='c000'>All the large department stores and the
clothing and shoe shops had been taken over
by the Government. Here and there, however,
were small private shops, selling goods
without regard to Government prices.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Soviet stores were arranged much like
our large department stores. One could go
in and buy various commodities, shoes in one
department, clothing in another, and so on.
Soviet employees had the right at all times to
purchase in these stores at Soviet prices.
They carried credentials showing they were
giving useful service to the Government.
Without credentials one could buy nothing—not
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>even food—except from the privately-owned
shops.</p>

<p class='c000'>To these the peasant speculators would
bring home-made bread in sacks and sell it
to the shop speculators, who in turn demanded
as much as eighty rubles a pound.
This was the only way of getting bread without
credentials because the Government had
taken control of the bakeries. In a Soviet
store a pound of bread could be bought for
ten rubles.</p>

<p class='c000'>All unnecessary labor in Soviet stores had
been eliminated. Young girls and women
acted as clerks; very few men were employed
in any capacity. The manager, who usually
was to be found on the first floor, was a man,
and he directed customers to the departments
which sold the things they wished to purchase.
The elevators were running not only
in the stores, but in the office buildings.</p>

<p class='c000'>White collars and white shirts could be
bought in some stores, but they were rationed
so that it would have been impossible to buy
three or four shirts at one time. The windows
in the stores were filled with articles,
but there was no attempt to display goods,
and there was no advertising.</p>

<p class='c000'>A shine, a shave and a hair-cut were obtainable
at the Soviet barber shops. They were
not rationed; one could buy as many of these
as desired.</p>

<p class='c000'>Theatres and operas were open and largely
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>attended in Moscow, and the actors and actresses,
as well as the singers, did not seem
to mind the cold.</p>

<p class='c000'>The streets were but dimly lighted, because
of the fuel shortage, but I saw and heard of
no crimes being committed. I wandered
about the city through many of its darkest
streets, at all hours of the night, and was
never molested. Now and then a policeman
demanded my permit, which, when I had
shown it, was accepted without question. The
city was well policed, the streets fairly clean,
and the government was doing everything
possible to prevent disease. Orders were
issued that all water must be boiled, but as
all Russians drink tea this order was not
unusual or difficult to carry out.</p>

<p class='c000'>The telephone and telegraph systems
seemed to me unusually good. Connections
by telephone between Moscow and Petrograd
were obtained in two minutes. Local service
was prompt and efficient, and connections
with wrong numbers were of rare occurrence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many newspapers were being published,
the size of all being limited on account of
the shortage of paper. In addition to the
Government newspapers and the Bolshevist
party papers there were papers of opposing
parties, notably publications controlled by
the Menshevists and the Social Revolutionists.</p>

<p class='c000'>All of them were free from the advertising
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>of business firms, since the Government had
nationalized all trade. Of course there was
no “funny page” or “Women’s Section.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as news came from the front great
bulletins were distributed through the city
and posted on the walls of buildings where
every one could read them. These bulletins
contained the news of both defeat and victory.
If prisoners had been taken or a retreat
had been necessary, the populace was
informed of it frankly. There was no attempt
to keep up the “morale” of the civilian
population by assuring it that all went well
and that victory was certain. Any one in
Soviet Russia who accepted the responsibilities
of the new order did so knowing that it
meant hardship and defeat—for a time.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Moscow many statues have been erected
since the revolution. Skobileff Square,—now
called Soviet Square,—has a statue of
Liberty which takes the place of the old
statue of Skobileff. I saw sculptors at work
all over the city, putting in medallions and
bas-reliefs, on public buildings. In Red
Square, along the Kremlin wall, are the
graves of many who fell in the revolution.
Sverdlov, formerly president of the executive
committee, and a close friend of Lenin, is
buried here. I was told that his death had
been a great loss to the Soviet Government.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moscow, like all the other Russian cities I
saw, had schools everywhere, art schools, musical
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>conservatories, technical schools, in addition
to the regular schools for children.</p>

<p class='c000'>On “Speculator’s Street” in Moscow all
kinds of private trading went on without interference.
I found this street thronged with
shoppers and with members of the old bourgeoisie
selling their belongings along the
curb; men and women unmistakably of the
former privileged classes offering, dress suits,
opera cloaks, evening gowns, shoes, hats, and
jewelry to any one who would pay them the
rubles that they, in turn, must give to the
exorbitant speculators for the very necessities
of life.</p>

<p class='c000'>These irreconcilables of the old regime, unwilling
to cooperate with the new government
and refusing to engage in useful work which
would entitle them to purchase their supplies
at the Soviet shops, at Soviet prices, were
compelled to resort to the speculators and under
pressure of the constantly decreasing
ruble and the wildly soaring prices, were
driven to sacrifice their valuables in order to
avoid starvation. Any one who desired and
who had the money could buy from the speculators;
but one pays dearly for pride in
Soviet Russia. The speculators charged seventy-five
rubles a pound for black bread that
could be bought in the Government shops for
ten rubles. The right to buy at the Soviet
shops and to eat in the Soviet restaurants was
to be had by the mere demonstration of a sincere
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>desire to do useful work of hand or
brain. Nevertheless these defenders of the
old order still held out—fewer of them
every day, to be sure—and the speculators
throve accordingly.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed at first glance a strange anomaly.
I could see through the windows of the speculator’s
shops canned goods and luxuries, and
even necessities, for which the majority of
the population were suffering. I asked why
the Government did not put its principles
into practice by requisitioning all these
stocks and ending the speculation. There
were many things in their program, the Bolshevists
said, which could not be carried out
at once because the energy of the Government
was consumed in the mobilization of all available
resources for national defence. There
were thousands of speculators all over Russia,
and it would take a small army to eliminate
them entirely. Half measures would
only drive them underground where they
would be a constant source of irritation and
anti-Government propaganda. It was better
to let them operate in the open, they said,
where they could be kept under observation
and restrained within certain limits.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile the speculators were eliminating
themselves and dragging with them the recalcitrant
bourgeoisie on whom they preyed.
Hoarded wealth and old finery do not last
forever. As the ruble falls and the speculator’s
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>prices rise their victims are compelled
to sacrifice more and more of their dwindling
resources. The Government prices are a standing
temptation to reconciliation. Only the
obdurate bourgeoisie and the speculators suffer
from the depreciation of the ruble. Every
two months wages are adjusted to meet depreciation,
by a Government commission
which acts in conjunction with the Central
Federation of All Russian Professional Alliances,
representing skilled and unskilled
labor. This serves to stabilize the purchasing
power of the workers earnings, although in
the past unavoidable and absolute dearth of
necessities has tended to work against this
stabilization.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the meantime the falling ruble and
the avaricious speculator between them drive
thousands of the stubborn into the category
of useful laborers. Every day brings numbers
who have, either through a change of
heart, or by economic necessity, been driven
to ask for work which will entitle them to
their bread and food cards. Thus the Communists,
too busy with the military defence
of their country to attend to the last measures
of expropriation, make use of the irresistible
economic forces of the old order
and allow the capitalists to expropriate themselves.</p>

<p>LENIN IN SWITZERLAND, MARCH, 1916</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I found no Red terror. There was serious
restriction of personal liberty and stern
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>enforcement of law and order, as might be
expected in a nation threatened with foreign
invasion, civil war, counter revolution, and
an actual blockade. While I was in Moscow
sixty men and seven women were shot for
complicity in a counter revolutionary plot.
They had arms stored in secret places and
had been found guilty of circularizing the
soldiers on the Denikin front, telling them
that Petrograd and Moscow had both fallen.
They made no concealment of their purpose to
overthrow the Government and went bravely
to their execution. Several days later two
bombs were exploded under a building in
which a meeting of the Executive Committee
of the Communist party was being held.
Eleven of the Communists were killed and
more than twenty wounded. The cadet counter
revolutionists, it was charged, committed
this outrage as reprisal for the execution of
their comrades. But no terror or persecution
followed. Instead great mass meetings were
held everywhere to protest against all terrorist
acts. Intrigue and propaganda were
met with counter propaganda and popular
enthusiasm for the Soviet Government.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before leaving Moscow for Petrograd I applied
at the Foreign Office for permission to
go to the Kremlin and interview Lenin. I
was told that permission would be granted,
and an appointment was made for me to
meet Lenin at his office at three o’clock on
the following day.</p>

<hr class='c016' />
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
  <h2 id='chap05' class='c005'>CHAPTER V <br />INTERVIEW WITH LENIN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>A quarter of an hour ahead of the
hour set for my appointment with
Lenin, I hastened to the Kremlin enclosure,
the well-guarded seat of the executive government.
Two Russian soldiers inspected
my pass and led me across a bridge to obtain
another pass from a civilian to enter the
Kremlin itself and to return to the outside.
I had heard that Lenin was guarded by
Chinese soldiers, but I looked in vain for a
Chinese among the guards that surrounded
the Kremlin. In fact I saw but two Chinese
soldiers during my entire stay in Soviet
Russia.</p>

<p class='c000'>I mounted the hill and went toward the
building where Lenin lives and has his office.
At the outer door two more soldiers met me,
inspected my passes, and directed me up a
long staircase, at the top of which stood two
more soldiers. They directed me down a long
corridor to another soldier who sat before a
door. This one inspected my passes and
finally admitted me to a large room in which
many clerks, both men and women, were busy
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>over desks and typewriters. In the next
room I found Lenin’s secretary who informed
me that “Comrade Lenin will be at
liberty in a few minutes.” It was then five
minutes before three. A clerk gave me a copy
of the <cite>London Times</cite>, dated September 2,
1919, and told me to sit down. While I read
an editorial the secretary addressed me and
asked me to go into the next room. As I
turned to the door it opened, and Lenin stood
waiting with a smile on his face.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was twelve minutes past three, and Lenin’s
first words were, “I am glad to meet
you, and I apologize for keeping you waiting.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Lenin is a man of middle height, close to
fifty years of age. He is well proportioned,
and very active, physically, in spite of the
fact that he carries in his body two bullets
fired at him in August, 1918. His head is
large, massive in outline, and is set close to
his shoulders. His forehead is broad and
high, his mouth large, the eyes wide apart
and there appears in them at times a very
infectious twinkle. His hair, pointed beard,
and mustache, have a brown tinge. His face
has wrinkles,—said by some to be wrinkles
of humor,—but I am inclined to believe them
the result of deep study, and of the suffering
he endured through long years of exile and
persecution. I would not minimize the contribution
that his sense of humor has made
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>to these lines and wrinkles, for no man who
lacked a sense of humor could have overcome
the obstacles he has met.</p>

<p class='c000'>During our conversation his eyes never left
mine. This direct regard was not that of a
man who wished to be on guard; it bespoke
a frank interest, which seemed to me to say,
“We shall be able to tell many things of interest
to each other. I believe you to be a
friend. In any event we shall have an interesting
talk.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He moved his chair close to his desk and
turned so that his knees were close to mine.
Almost at once he began asking me about the
labor movement in America, and from that
he went on to discuss the labor situation in
other countries. He was thoroughly informed
even as to the most recent developments
everywhere. I soon found myself asking
him questions.</p>

<p class='c000'>I told him that the press of various countries
had been saying that Soviet Russia was
a dictatorship of a small minority. He replied,
"Let those who believe that silly tale
come here and mingle with the rank and file
and learn the truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The vast majority of industrial workers
and at least one-half of the articulate peasantry
are for Soviet rule, and are prepared to
defend it with their lives.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You say you have been along the Western
Front,” he continued. “You admit that
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>you have been allowed to mingle with the
soldiers of Soviet Russia, that you have been
unhampered in making your investigation.
You have had a very good opportunity to
understand the temper of the rank and file.
You have seen thousands of men living from
day to day on black bread and tea. You have
probably seen more suffering in Soviet Russia
than you had ever thought possible, and
all this because of the unjust war being made
upon us, including the economic blockade, in
all of which your own country is playing a
large part. Now I ask you what is your
opinion about this being a dictatorship of the
minority?”</p>

<p class='c000'>I could only answer that from what I had
seen and experienced I could not believe that
these people, who had found their strength
and overthrown a despotic Czar, would ever
submit to such privations and sufferings except
in defence of a government in which,
however imperfect, they had ultimate faith,
and which they were prepared to defend
against all odds.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What have you to say at this time about
peace and foreign concessions?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>He answered, “I am often asked whether
those American opponents of the war
against Russia—as in the first place bourgeois—are
right who expect from us, after
peace is concluded, not only resumption of
trade relations but also the possibility of securing
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>concessions in Russia. I repeat once
more that they are right. A durable peace
would be such a relief to the toiling masses
of Russia that these masses would undoubtedly
agree to certain concessions being
granted. The granting of concessions under
reasonable terms is also desirable to us, as
one of the means of attracting into Russia
the technical help of the countries which are
more advanced in this respect, during the
co-existence side by side of Socialist and capitalist
states.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In reply to my next question about Soviet
power he replied:</p>

<p class='c000'>"As for the Soviet power, it has become
familiar to the minds and hearts of the laboring
masses of the whole world which clearly
grasped its meaning. Everywhere the laboring
masses, in spite of the influence of the
old leaders with their chauvinism and opportunism
which permeates them through and
through, became aware of the rottenness of
the bourgeois parliaments and of the necessity
of the Soviet power, the power of the
toiling masses, the dictatorship of the proletariat,
for the sake of the emancipation of
humanity from the yoke of capital. And
the Soviet power will win in the whole world,
however furiously, however frantically the
bourgeoisie of all countries may rage and
storm.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The bourgeoisie inundates Russia with
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>blood, waging war upon us and inciting
against us the counter revolutionaries, those
who wish the yoke of capital to be restored.
The bourgeoisie inflict upon the working
masses of Russia unprecedented sufferings,
through the blockade, and through their help
given to the counter revolutionaries, but we
have already defeated Kolchak and we are
carrying on the war against Denikin with the
firm assurance of our coming victory.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In his replies to my last questions he had
covered the ground of the others on my list,
and since the fifteen minutes allotted to me
had extended to more than an hour, I rose
to go. I intended to ask him about “nationalization
of women.” I had never believed
the story, and had already discovered that it
was false, but I had thought to ask Lenin
how the story arose. When I met him and
had talked to him something in his face
silenced the question. Perhaps it was the
mocking humor that seemed ready to flash
out of the wrinkled countenance in scathing
ridicule, or perhaps it was the sign of long-suffering
and profound thought that lay
deeper. Whatever it was I did not ask that
question. I had seen for myself that women
in Soviet Russia are shown a respect and
deference far exceeding the superficial politeness
which in other countries too often serves
to conceal political, economic, and domestic
oppression. Women are on an equal footing
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>in all respects with men in Russia, and they
enjoy a greater measure of freedom and
security than the women of other countries.</p>

<p class='c000'>He shook hands cordially, and I went
away cudgelling my brains to find another figure
among the statesmen of the world with
whom I might compare him. I could think
only of our own Lincoln, whose image came
to me, suggested perhaps by the simplicity
and plainness of Lenin’s attire. Workman’s
shoes, worn trousers, a soft shirt with a black
four-in-hand tie, a cheap office coat, and the
kindly strong face and figure,—these were
my impressions of the man.</p>

<p class='c000'>He works from fifteen to eighteen hours a
day, receiving reports, keeping in touch with
the situation all over Russia, attending committee
meetings, making speeches, always
ready to give anyone advice, counsel, or suggestion.
He lives with his wife who is most
loyal and devoted, in the same building where
he has his office, in two modestly furnished
rooms.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soviet rule has captured not only the imagination,
but also the intellects of the majority
of the rank and file of Russia. Lenin
is looked upon as the highest representative
of that principle; he is trusted and he is
loved. I was told that so many people come
to see him from the outlying districts, men,
women, and children, that it is impossible
for him to see them all. They bring him
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>bread, eggs, butter, and fruit,—and he turns
all into the common fund.</p>

  <h2 id='chap06' class='c005'>CHAPTER VI <br /> “WHO IS LENIN?”</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Many conflicting stories were told and
published about Lenin after the Bolshevist
uprising in November, 1917. I decided
to ascertain for myself during the two
weeks I spent in Switzerland before going
into Russia what the people of that country
knew about him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lenin arrived in Switzerland in September,
1914, and left for Russia in March, 1917,
with thirty other Russians, on the much-talked-of
train that went through Germany
with the sanction of the Kaiser.</p>

<p class='c000'>A whole myth has grown up around Lenin
since his return to Russia. He was a German
agent; he was sent from Switzerland to Russia
through Germany; he went for the express
purpose of fomenting revolution in order to
break down the morale of the Russian Army
and to make it possible for German militarism
to conquer. Document after document was
printed to prove that this man was mercenary,
that he was cold-blooded, without ideals of any
kind, and that he had received millions in
money from the Germans, whose plans he
conscientiously carried out,—at least in connection
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>with the disorganization of the Russian
Army. While in Switzerland for two
years during the war, he lived in luxury, always
had plenty of money which was supplied
from an unknown source, later discovered
to be the banks of Germany.</p>

<p class='c000'>I found when I went to Zurich that Lenin
had passed the greater part of his time when
in Switzerland in that town, and had lived
in the poor quarter of the city. The house
in which he and his wife lived, No. 14 Spiegelgasse,
is on a very narrow street running
down to the quay. They lived in one room
on the second floor of this house. Their
meagre furniture included a table, a washstand,
two plain chairs, a small stove, a bed,
a couch, and a petrol lamp. The room had
a plaster ceiling and was unpapered, the bare
board walls seeming most bleak. A cheap,
dingy carpet covered the floor. The room
was accessible only through a dark narrow
corridor. On the same floor were three
other rooms, two of which were occupied by
two families, and the third was used as a
common kitchen by every one. In this kitchen
Lenin’s wife, who was his constant companion,
only secretary and assistant, prepared
their frugal meals and carried them to their
room.</p>

<p class='c000'>For these quarters Lenin paid thirty-eight
francs a month, the equivalent of six dollars
and sixty cents in American money.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>I was told by many people who had known
him in Zurich that Lenin seemed to wish to
mingle only with working people there. His
revolutionary friends took great pride in saying,
“He never spent any time with mere intellectual
reformers.” They told me that
much of his time was passed in the Swiss
Workers’ Assembly, where he talked to every
one, but never made any speeches. He did
speak, however, on many occasions in the
Russian Assembly in Zurich.</p>

<p class='c000'>His income was derived from articles written
for Russian party papers. Before leaving
for Russia he closed his account at a
Zurich bank and drew out the balance on
deposit there, which amounted to twenty-five
francs.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a short time while in Switzerland Lenin
lived in Berne, in two rooms. I met the
woman at whose Pension he dined while
there. She said she had served Lenin, his
wife, and his wife’s mother midday dinners
while they stayed there. The price of those
meals was eighty centimes each,—approximately
sixteen cents. She informed me that
they prepared their own breakfasts and evening
meals.</p>

<p class='c000'>The proprietor of the Wiener café, a coffee
house located on the corner of Schrittfaren
and Gurtengasse in Berne, told me that he
remembered Lenin well, that he had come
into his place on a number of occasions for
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>a cup of coffee. “He spent most of his time
here reading the papers and talking with the
waiters,” he said, and described him as
always being poorly dressed.</p>

<p class='c000'>None of these simple people thought of
Lenin as a person of any greater importance
than themselves. He was one of them,
a serious student who mingled with working
people, eager to tell them of their importance
in the political world.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Czar was overthrown and the
Kerensky Government came into power,
a committee of all the Socialist parties in
Switzerland except the “Social Patriots”
made an effort to assist in getting Russian
exiles back to their own country.
This committee collected the money for the
transportation of the exiles. They endeavored
to secure from France, England, and
Switzerland permission for their passage
through Archangel to Petrograd, but the
Allied governments denied this permit. Then
the Swiss Socialists entered into negotiations
with the German Government to secure passage
through Germany. On condition that
an equal number of civilian prisoners then
held in Russia be allowed to return to Germany,
the German Government agreed to the
passage of the immigrants through Germany.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following statement, signed by the
members of the Committee, is given in full,
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>even to the peculiar English of the translation.</p>

    <div><em>“The Return of the Russian Emigrants.”</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>In view of the fact that the Entente newspapers
have recently published a series of
sensational and false accounts and articles regarding
the return of the Russian comrades
(Lenin, Zinovieff and others) branding them
as accomplices and agents of Imperial Germany,
as coworkers of the German Government.
Simultaneously the German and Austrian
press is attempting to represent these
Russian revolution comrades as pacifists and
separate peace advocates, we therefore deem
it necessary to publish the following explanation
under the Signature of the Comrades of
France, Germany, Poland and Switzerland
to whitewash the Comrades that departed to
Russia.</p>

<p class='c000'>We the undersigned are aware of the hindrances
which the governments of the Entente
are putting in the way of our Russian
Internationalists in their departure. They
learned of the conditions which the German
Government has placed before them for their
passage through to Sweden.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not having the slightest doubt as to the
fact, that the German Government is speculating
by it to strengthen the one-sided anti-war
tendencies in Russia, we declare:</p>

<p class='c000'>The Russian Internationalists who during
the whole war period have been combating
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>in the sharpest possible manner imperialism
in general and the German imperialism
in particular, and who are now going to Russia
in order to work there for the cause of
the Revolution, will thus be aiding the proletarians
of all countries as well, and particularly
the German and Austrian working class
by encouraging them to the revolutionary
struggle against their own governments.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing can be more stimulating and inspiring
in this respect than the example of
the heroic struggle on the part of the Russian
proletariat. For that reason we the undersigned
Internationalists of France, Switzerland,
Poland and Germany consider it to be
not only the right but a duty on the part of
our Russian comrades to use the opportunity
for the voyage to Russia, which is offered to
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>We wish them the best results in the struggle
against the Imperialistic policy of Russian
bourgeoisie, which constitutes a part of
our general struggle for the liberation of the
working class, for the social revolution.</p>

In July the French and English governments
finally granted permission for a train-load to
pass through those countries to Archangel

months. I learned that the May and July
trains also carried to Russia many active
Menshevists, supporters of the Kerensky

<p class='c000'>In August another group tried to return,
but because Kerensky protested, the French

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Zinovieff, in an address to the Petrograd
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>Soviet, September 6, 1918, told the story of
the fabled armored train as follows:</p>

<p class='c000'>“In March, 1917, Lenin returned to Russia.
Do you remember the cries that went
up about the ‘armored train’ on which Lenin
and the rest of us returned? In reality
Lenin felt a profound hatred of German
imperialism. He hated it no less than he
hated any other brand of imperialism....
When a prominent member of the Scheidemann
party attempted to enter our car (which
was not armored) in order to ‘greet’ us, he
was told, at Lenin’s suggestion, that we would
not speak to traitors and that he would be
sparing himself insult if he refrained from
trying to enter. The Mensheviki and the
Social Revolutionists, who were rather stubborn
at first, later on came back to Russia in
the same way (more than three hundred of
them). Lenin put the matter simply, ‘All
bourgeois governments are brigands: we have
no choice since we cannot get into Russia by
any other way.’”</p>

<p class='c000'>I found the following in a long article of
appreciation written by Ernest Nobs, editor
of the Swiss <cite>Volkrecht</cite>, published in Zurich
in December, 1917.</p>

<p class='c000'>“One who has seen the last winter, the
medium-sized, square-built man, with a somewhat
yellowish face and sharp, sparkling
and flashing Mongol eyes, as he was steering
towards some library in a wornout ulster
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>coat, with a heap of books under his arm,
could hardly foresee in him the future Russian
premier.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the address mentioned on the foregoing
page, delivered at the time Lenin was shot,
Zinovieff said:</p>

<p class='c000'>Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanoff (Lenin) was
born on April 10, 1870, in the city of Simbirsk.
His father, who was of peasant descent,
was employed as Director of Public
Schools in the Volga region. His elder brother,
Alexander Ulyanoff was executed by
Czar Alexander III. From that time on his
mother showered all her tender affections on
Vladimir Ilyich, and Lenin in his turn dearly
loved her. Living as an emigrant, an exile,
persecuted by the Czar’s Government, Lenin
used to tear himself away from the most
urgent tasks to go to Switzerland to see his
mother in her last days. She died in 1913.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon his graduation from high school
(gymnasium) Vladimir Ilyich entered the
law school at the Kazan University. The universities
of the capitals were closed to him
because he was the brother of an executed
revolutionist. A month after his entry he
was expelled from the University for participation
in a revolutionary movement of the
students. It was not until four years had
gone by that he was allowed to resume his
studies. The legal career held no attractions
for Lenin. His natural inclinations
lay towards the field of revolutionary activity....
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>When he was expelled from
the Kazan University he went to Petrograd.
The first phase of his activities was
confined to student circles. A year or two
later he created in Petrograd the first ‘workmen’s
circles’ and a little later crossed swords
on the literary arena with the old leader of
the Populists, N. K. Mikhailovsky. Under
the <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom de plume</span></em> of Ilyin, Lenin published
a series of brilliant articles on economics
which at once won him a name.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Petrograd he, with other workers,
founded the ‘Union for the Emancipation of
the Working Class,’ and conducted the first
labor strikes, writing meanwhile leaflets and
pamphlets remarkable for their simplicity of
style and clarity. These were printed on a
hectograph and distributed.... Very
often now workers coming from far off Siberia
or the Ural to the All-Russian Congress
of Soviets recall to him their activities together
in the early 90’s. They recognize that
he was their teacher, the first to kindle the
spark of communism in them.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the 90’s Lenin was sentenced to a long
prison term and then exiled. While in exile
he devoted himself to scientific and literary
activities, and wrote a number of books. One
of these reached a circle of exiles in Switzerland,
among whom were Plekhanoff, Axelrod,
and Zasulich, who welcomed Lenin as the harbinger
of a coming season, and who could not
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>find words of praise sufficiently strong.
Another book, a truly scientific one, won the
praise of Professor Maxim Kovalevsky of the
Paris School of Social Science. “What a
good professor Lenin would have made!” he
said.</p>

<p class='c000'>Vladimir Ilyich languished in exile like
a caged lion. The only thing that saved him
was the fact that he was leading the life of
a scientist. He used to spend fifteen hours
daily in the library over books, and it is not
without reason that he is now one of the most
cultured men of our time.... In 1901
Lenin, together with a group of intimate
friends, began the publication of a newspaper,
<cite>Iskra, The Spark</cite>. This paper not only
waged a political struggle, but it carried on
vast organizing activities, and Lenin was the
soul of the organizing committee.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lenin’s wife, Nadezhda Konstantinovna
Krupskaya Ulyanova was the secretary of
<cite>Iskra</cite> and the secretary of the organizing
committee. Throughout Lenin’s activities
as an organizer a considerable share of
the credit is due to his wife. All the
correspondence was in her charge. At one
time she was in communication with entire
Russia. Who did not know her? Martov
in his bitter controversy with Lenin once
called her "Secretary of Lenin, the Super-Center."...</p>

<p class='c000'>In the summer of 1905 the first conference
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>of the Bolsheviki was called. Officially
it was known as the Third Conference of the
Revolutionary Social Democratic Labor
Party. This conference laid the corner-stone
for the present Communist Party.... In the
revolution of 1905 Lenin’s part was enormous,
although he was residing in Petrograd
illegally and was forbidden by the party to
attend its meetings openly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Vladimir Ilyich was exiled for the second
time in 1907. In Geneva, and later in
Paris, chiefly through the efforts of Lenin,
the newspapers, <cite>The Proletarian</cite> and <cite>The
Social Democrat</cite> were founded. Complete
decadence was reigning all around. Obscene
literature took the place of art literature. The
spirit of nihilism permeated the sphere of
politics. Stolypin was indulging in his orgies.
And it seemed as if there was no end
to all this.</p>

<p class='c000'>At such times true leaders reveal themselves.
Vladimir Ilyich suffered at that time,
as he did right along in exile, the greatest
personal privations. He lived like a pauper,
he was sick and starved, especially when he
lived in Paris. But he retained his courage
as no one else did. He stood firmly and
bravely at his post. He alone knew how
to weld together a circle of gallant fighters
to whom he used to say, “Do not lose your
courage. The dark days will pass, a few
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>years will elapse, and the proletarian revolution
will be revived.”</p>

<p class='c000'>For two years Lenin scarcely left the
national library at Paris, and during this
time he accomplished such a large amount
of work that even those very professors who
were attempting to ridicule his philosophic
works admitted that they could not understand
how a man could do so much.</p>

<p class='c000'>The years 1910–11 brought a fresh breeze
to stir the atmosphere. It became clear in
1911 that the workers’ movement was beginning
to revive. We had in Petrograd a paper,
the <cite>Star</cite>, (<cite>Zviezda</cite>), and in Moscow
a magazine, <cite>Thought</cite> (<cite>Mysl</cite>), and there was
a small labor representation in the Duma.
And the principal worker both on these papers
and for the Duma representation was
Lenin. He taught the principles of revolutionary
parliamentarism to the labor deputies
in the Duma. “You just get up and tell
the whole of Russia plainly about the life of
the worker. Depict the horrors of the capitalist
galleys, call upon the workers to revolt,
fling into the face of the black Duma the name
of ‘scoundrels and exploiters.’” At first they
found this strange advice. The entire Duma
atmosphere was depressing, its members and
ministers met in the Tauride palace, clad
in full dress suits. They learned their lessons
however.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1912 we started to lead a new life.
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>At the January conference of that year the
Bolsheviki reunited their ranks which had
been broken up by the counter revolution.
At the request of the new Central Executive
Committee Lenin and myself went to Krakov
(Cracow, in Galicia). There comrades
began to come to us from Petrograd, Moscow,
and elsewhere. I recall the first large
general meeting of the Petrograd metal
workers, in 1913. Two hours after our candidates
had been elected to the executive committee
Lenin received a wire from the metal
workers, congratulating him upon the victory.
He lived a thousand versts away from
Petrograd, yet he was the very soul of the
workers of Petrograd. It was a repetition of
what took place in 1906–7 when Lenin lived
in Finland, and we used to visit him every
week to receive counsel from him. From the
little village of Kuokalla, in Finland, he
steered the labor movement of Petrograd.</p>

<p class='c000'>In 1915–17 Lenin was leading a very peculiar
life in Switzerland. The war and the
collapse of the International had a very
marked effect on him. Many of his comrades
who knew him well were surprised at the
changes wrought in him by the war.</p>

<p class='c000'>He never felt very tenderly toward the
bourgeoisie, but with the beginning of the
war he began to nurture a concentrated, keen,
intense hatred for them. It seemed that his
very countenance had changed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>In Zurich he resided in the poorest quarter,
in the flat of a shoemaker. He appeared
to be after every single proletarian, trying
as it were to get hold of him and explain
that the war was an imperialistic slaughter....
Lenin has always understood what
enormous difficulties would arise before the
working class after it had seized all power.
From the first days of his arrival in Petrograd
he carefully observed the economic disruption.
He valued his acquaintance with
every bank employee, striving to penetrate
into all the details of the banking business.
He was well aware of the provisioning problem,
and of other difficulties. In one of his
most remarkable books he dwells at length on
these difficulties. On the question of the
nationalization of banks, in the domain of the
provisioning policy and on the war question
Lenin has said the decisive word. He worked
out concretely the plan of practical measures
to be adopted in all domains of national life,
long before October 25, (November 7),
1917. The plan is clear, concrete, distinct,
like all his works....</p>

</div>

<p class='c014'>I arrived at the Nicolai station in
Petrograd on the 24th of September,
from Moscow, and went at once to the Astoria
hotel on St. Isaac’s Square at the farther
end of Nevsky Prospekt. As we drove along
the thoroughfare I noticed workmen tearing
out the wooden paving-blocks which covered
that famous street, and recalled having read
in New York papers that whole streets in
Petrograd had been torn up and used for
fuel. This seemed credible enough, even desirable,
I thought, as I recalled the shivering
nights I had spent in Russia. When my
droshky came nearer to the crew of workers
I saw worn and broken blocks piled to one
side; in their places new blocks had been put
in. Two days later I walked along this same
thoroughfare from one end to the other, still
looking for unmended gaps in the paving.
My search was vain. And the pavements of
the side streets, on which I walked miles
during my stay in Petrograd, were in good
condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many of the shops along Nevsky Prospekt
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>were closed and boarded up, and those
that remained open had but few wares on their
shelves. The large stores, however, now converted
into Soviet stores, were all open and
contained a goodly supply of various commodities,
but the bright-colored toys that used
to fill the shop windows of Petrograd had
entirely disappeared. Apparently the peasants
of Russia, busy with weightier matters,
had found no time to carve grotesque wooden
figures and charming dolls and the other
gayly-colored toys they know so well how to
make. The Russian child who does not have
these toys left over from the old days has to
do without.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whatever beautiful things Russia still had,
however, were placed in the stores along with
the necessities. They were not regarded as
luxuries for the few. Art belongs to every
one in Soviet Russia.</p>

<p class='c000'>I learned that the high wall which used to
surround the Winter Palace of the Czar had
been torn down, and when I asked why this
had been done, was told that there was a
beautiful garden back of this wall, and since
“beauty should not be hidden from the people,”
they had torn down the wall so that
all might see the garden. The palace itself
was unoccupied. Its art treasures had been
removed to Moscow, and placed in museums
there. It was planned to make a museum of
the palace later.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>On my second day in Petrograd I went out
to Smolny Institute, a large stone structure
overlooking the Neva, formerly a school for
the daughters of the aristocracy, now the
office building of the officials and workers of
the Northern Commune and Petrograd
Soviet.</p>

<p class='c000'>In front of the institute there was set up
a large statue of Karl Marx. It looked impressive
enough from a distance. But when
I passed on my way into the building and
looked back at the statue I discovered Karl
Marx—a silk hat in his hand. I have not
yet been able to get over my memory of the
great economist standing there, heroically
erect, before the headquarters of the workingmen’s
government, holding a silk hat.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Smolny Institute I met Zinovieff, president
of the Petrograd Soviet, a curly-haired,
impetuous Jew, full of energy and with a
deep understanding of the Russian revolutionary
movement. He has been a life-long
friend of Lenin and was his companion in
exile. I found him distrustful at first, but
very cordial when convinced that my intentions
were honest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you still talk about nationalization of
women in America?” he asked me with a
broad grin. He was the only official in Soviet
Russia who ever mentioned the subject to me.</p>

<p class='c000'>Later in the day I attended a meeting of
the Petrograd Soviets which included representatives
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>of all unions, army, navy and
peasants. They were assembled in the Tauride
Palace, where the Duma met formerly.
A decree for compulsory education for adults
was under consideration, and Zinovieff spoke
for the adoption of the decree. I could not,
of course, understand his impassioned address,
which subsequent translation revealed
to be a clear analysis of the whole educational
problem. He has a high-pitched voice,
which grated on my ears sometimes, but rang
with earnestness and conviction. The decree,
which is now in effect, was passed by a practically
unanimous vote.</p>

<p class='c000'>It provided that after November 1, 1919,
all adults of the Northern Commune unable
to read and write would have to attend public
school classes two hours daily for six months,
at the end of which time those unable to
pass the examinations were to be denied the
right to work. For their hours of study the
decree provided that they be paid wages at
the rate in effect in their branches of industry.</p>

<p class='c000'>For those illiterates in occupations requiring
eight hours labor, the working day was
reduced to six, giving them the opportunity
to spend the full two hours in school. The
six-hour day in force in the hazardous occupations
was reduced to four hours.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soviet officials informed me that passage
of the decree did not mean that those who
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>were unable to assimilate knowledge would
be denied the right to work. That disciplining
would be invoked only for those capable ones
who wilfully refused to study. The measure
was but one of the efforts of the Soviet Government
to hasten the development of the
intellectual side of the people’s life and to
raise culture in general. Under Czars there
were few public schools, and these were inefficiently
conducted. Seventy-five percent of
the people could not read or write.</p>

<p class='c000'>I inquired about the “Red Terror” in
Petrograd. “Yes,” I was informed, “there
were two or three days of Red Terror in
August, 1918, when Lenin was shot, in
Moscow.” The rank and file were devoted
to this man, and when they heard of the
attempt on his life they turned loose, and it
took three days of hard work on the part of
the government officials and the government
party members to stop the rush of the mob.
Probably two thousand were killed, and during
the six weeks that Lenin lay between
life and death great crowds of working people
watched the bulletins from his physicians
that were posted on walls in all parts of the
city from day to day. I was told that
quite aside from his value to the government
itself, it was a godsend to Russia that he
survived, because his death would have meant
an uprising that would have spared no human
being believed to be in opposition to Lenin
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>and the Soviet Government. Even Zinovieff
is reported to have lost his head for a little
time, when he heard of the precarious condition
of his old friend and comrade.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Russian friend of mine in America had
asked me to look for his father who lived
two or three blocks from St. Isaac’s Square
when last heard from four years before.</p>

<p class='c000'>I found the old man in his place of business—a
picture frame store. He lived with
his wife in two or three rooms in the rear.
He had been in business for years, and was
one of the bourgeoisie of the olden days.
When I asked him if he had been disturbed
by the Bolsheviki he said that during the two
years since the revolution his store had been
visited once by the authorities—an officer
came to inquire for the address of some person
living in the immediate neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c000'>I asked him how he liked the new regime.
“I don’t like it because food is scarce and
prices high.” He showed me a small picture
frame. “Before the war I could sell this for
70 kopecks, now I must charge 40 rubles,—but
then maybe it was the war and not the
revolution that caused the high prices,—I
don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He took me down the street three blocks to
visit his daughter, so that when I returned
to America I could assure my friend that his
sister, too, was safe. She and her husband
were both working for the Soviet Government
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>and had but one complaint to make,
“scarcity of food.” She was a teacher in one
of the Soviet schools. They had two beautiful
boys; the elder was studying sculpture in
a Soviet art school, the younger was still
in the grades. I asked this most intelligent
and refined woman whether the Bolshevists
had broken up the homes in Petrograd. She
smiled and said, “Do they believe that in
America?” When I had to answer that
“some do,” she replied, “Please tell them it
does not show intelligence to believe such
things.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I talked to three or four of the business
men along the Nevsky Prospekt who were still
clinging to their little shops, with their pitiful
stocks of goods. These people have remained
undisturbed for reasons I have already
explained. In substance they all said
the same thing: “It is terrible,—terrible.
Before long we must quit business. The Bolshevists
are setting up what they call ‘Soviet’
stores. The people don’t come to us now,—only
a few of our old customers. The Soviet
stores control the products and undersell us.
Russia is doomed. We want to go away.
How is it in America?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The last cry of the private shopkeeper in
Russia! Some day when the war is over and
Russia is doing business with the rest of the
world, these same shopkeepers will probably
find the Soviet stores more attractive even
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>than their own. They may remember, with
no regret, their constant struggle to survive
competition. Doubtless they will get behind
the counters of the Soviet stores, as many of
their kind have already done, and there find
security of employment and compensation,
and in the knowledge that they are rendering
a real service to the New Russia they will find
an adequate substitute for the stimulation of
“private enterprise.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With the removal of the capital to Moscow,
the sending of thousands of workers to the
army, the voluntary emigration to the villages
of thousands of others, and the exodus
of the bourgeoisie to Scandinavia, France,
England and even America, Petrograd has
probably one half the population it had under
the Czar. Moscow had gained, however, during
the same period in greater proportion
than Petrograd lost.</p>

<p>CHICHERIN<br /><span class='small'>Commissar of Foreign Affairs</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Tram cars were running more regularly
than in Moscow, so far as I could observe.
The streets were poorly lighted, as in Moscow,
and for the same reason. All automobiles
had been requisitioned by the army and were
used mostly for trucking. The city was
policed by women in daytime, by men at
night. It was rather startling to encounter
a woman policeman with a rifle on her
shoulder, but the people took it for granted,
and I was told that the women were quite
as efficient as the men. In spite of poor
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>lighting, Petrograd is as safe as Moscow at
night—or as safe as New York or Chicago,
for that matter. Prostitution has lost its
clientele. Thousands of women from the
streets have found decent employment in
various institutions of the Soviet Government,
and are able to lead independent, normal
lives.</p>

<p class='c000'>I visited one of the large textile industries,
which was in full operation, employing probably
three thousand men and women. They
were making civilian suits and overcoats and
winter coats for the soldiers. Motor lorries
drove up and carried away thousands of
these winter coats for shipment to the soldiers
at the front.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the factories were closing down
through lack of fuel. I asked what would
become of the workers who were thrown out
of employment, and was told that pending
their re-employment they would be given
“out of work” cards showing that their idleness
was not voluntary, and the government
would continue to pay them their regular
wages.</p>

<p class='c000'>I visited Maxim Gorky in his modest apartment
near the Fortress of Peter and Paul.
Gorky is typical of a large class of the intellectuals.
Two years ago he was a bitter
opponent of Bolshevism, and his writings
violently attacked the government.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of artistic rather than political temperament,
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>and strongly pacifist, he was sickened
by the killing on both sides. Since then,
however, he has come to the support of the
Soviet Government. His tribute to the constructive
ability of the Soviet leaders was
issued over his signature a year ago, and has
been widely circulated.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had been told that Maxim Gorky was
suffering from tuberculosis, and after all the
misery I had seen in Soviet Russia because
of the lack of food, I expected to find him
emaciated. Instead, he was vigorous and
healthy. He stood before me tall, powerful,
with a slight bend in his shoulders. He
seemed with his mass of gray hair like some
huge and fearless animal.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was sadness in his voice and his
gray eyes when he spoke of Russia’s suffering.
Gorky himself was a child of the streets,
and he feels keenly the suffering of the
people.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it was when he spoke of the future of
his country that he was the true Russian.
He told me he believed in the invincible spirit
of the Russian masses and their determination
to defend “their revolution.” He dwelt
with pride upon the accomplishments of individual
workers, whose native genius had
been set free from the old bondage. I was
surprised to find the interest he took in the
industries. In one factory just outside of
Petrograd, he told me, they were extracting
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>sugar from the sawdust of certain woods by
a process discovered by a workman. With
equal enthusiasm he told me of another
worker who had perfected a method of preserving
fish nets so that their durability had
been increased four hundred percent.</p>

<p class='c000'>He told me a manifesto would soon be
issued to the world, coming from a number
of Russian scientists of established reputation,
setting forth the scientific achievements
accomplished under Soviet rule.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Under two years of Soviet rule,” Gorky
said, “there have been more discoveries made
in Russia and there has been more progress
in general than previously in twenty years
under Czarism.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The greatest joy that Gorky finds in his
work for the Soviet Government is in the
tremendous task of preserving the art of old
Russia and creating new art. Even in the
throes of the revolution when Gorky opposed
the Bolshevik rule, he was working with the
government to preserve the old art.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under his direction a museum was established
in a fine structure, wherein were stored
thousands of art treasures recovered during
the revolution. Bourgeoisie who fled to other
countries left their unoccupied homes full of
beautiful things. The Soviet Government
took possession of these homes at once and
removed valuable art to the museum. Manifestos
were sent broadcast appealing to the
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>people to preserve these things which were
now theirs. In Petrograd the following bulletin,
under the title “Appeal for the Preservation
of Works of Art,” appeared:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Citizens! The old landlords have gone.
Behind them remains a tremendous inheritance.
Now it belongs to the whole people.
Guard this inheritance; take care of the
palaces. They will stand as the palaces of
the art of the whole people. Preserve the
pictures, the statues, the buildings—these are
a concentration of the spiritual force of yourselves
and of your forefathers. Art is that
beauty which men of talent have been able
to create even under the lash of despotism.
Do not touch a single stone, safeguard monuments,
buildings, ancient things, and documents.
All these are your history, your
pride.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But it was impossible to save everything,”
Gorky told me. “There were the soldiers
and the peasants, who had never had a chance
to see any of these beautiful things in the
past. The people did not wish to destroy
these things. They only threw away what
seemed worthless to them. One priceless
painting was found in a garbage can. But
it was found and brought back by the people
themselves. And now it is in the museum
where every one may see it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gorky is head of the “World Literature
Publishing House,” a vast institution organized
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>by the Soviet Government to publish
the best literary and scientific productions
of all countries in popular editions for
the Russian masses. A great staff of literary
and professional men and women are enrolled
in this work. Already about six hundred
books have been edited and are ready for
publication, although only thirty volumes had
been printed when the work had to stop on account
of the lack of paper. As soon as paper
is available they hope to begin printing millions
of volumes in editions which will be
within the reach of all the Russian people.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to this work Gorky has been
devoting much time to the preparation of a
series of motion-picture scenarios, composed
with scientific historical exactness, showing
the history of man from the Stone Age down
through the Middle Ages to the time of
Louis XVI of France, and finally to the
present day. This work was begun in July
1919, and when I talked with Gorky in September
of the same year, he told me that they
had already finished twenty-five scenarios.
He described the extraordinary difficulties
under which the work was going forward;
the actors and actresses who were often undernourished,
persevered over all obstacles,
inspired by an enthusiasm which Gorky
thought would have been impossible in any
other country. The Soviet Government was
aiding the production in every way. The best
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>actors and actresses in the country had been
enlisted in this work along with historians
and scientists. The films were being sent into
the remote towns and villages, and thousands
of small theatres already were being built.</p>

<p class='c000'>The motion picture theatres in general in
Petrograd were not showing the ordinary
romances that we see in this country in films.
The motion picture was used largely for educating
the people and showing the development
of industry, the proper care of children
and the advantages of sanitary conditions.
Russia is in great need of education so far
as sanitation is concerned. In the large cities
the sanitation is modern, but in smaller towns
and in the villages the people have no idea of
a sewage system.</p>

<p class='c000'>The theatre of Soviet Russia had already
been organized throughout the country at the
time of my visit. The production of plays
and scenarios was included in the educational
program of the government. The theatres
were organized into one corporation and subsidized
by the Soviet Government, which did
not, however, interfere in any way with the
artistic work of the producers. I saw
Schiller’s “Robbers” and Gorky’s “Lower
Depths” produced wonderfully. The people
crowded to the theatres. The first four performances
each week are set aside for the
Soviet workers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gorky assured me that the elements opposed
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>to Soviet rule “do not find any support
among the rank and file. The working class
strongly supports the Soviets, and most of
the peasants approve, although the village
youth is still indifferent.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Jewish people were playing an important
part in the revolutionary reconstruction
of the country, Gorky said, but added that he
did not mean the class of Jews who had been
influential in the old régime. The Jews who
had come forward under the revolution were
the ones who had formerly been kept within
the pale. They felt that a new freedom had
been offered them by the Soviet Government,
that they would be treated as brothers, and
so they were rendering valuable constructive
service.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If they would only leave us alone,” he
cried out bitterly. “Tell America for the
sake of humanity to leave Russia alone.”
His words fairly burned as he sat there and
talked, emphasizing each phrase with a gesture
of his clenched fists. “Tell them to leave
us alone. I know quite well that there are
many persons in America who have no vision
of this Russia, who have no comprehension
of what Russia is. But after all, you have
a few enlightened people in America. Please
tell them that Russia is not Central Africa,
without civilization or statesmanship. Russia
is well able to take care of herself.”</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c017'>TROTZKY</h3>

<p class='c014'>Almost inseparable from the name of
Lenin, in the minds of Americans, is
that of Trotzky, Minister of War, whose history
is well known here. He was Minister
of Foreign Affairs up to the time of the
signing of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, when it
became necessary to mobilize an army to
protect Soviet Russia from foreign invasion,
and he was made Minister of War. He took
hold of a badly disorganized and worse discouraged
army, and through his own hard
work, and with the assistance of others, built
up an army probably better than any other
in the world today.</p>

<p class='c000'>While in Moscow I heard him address a
gathering of some two thousand women, in
the Labor Temple—formerly a noblemen’s
club. He had just returned from the front,
and was still wearing his suit of plain khaki
and high boots. He reviewed the work of the
Red Army, recounting its victories and
defeats.</p>

<div id='i102'  class='figcenter id009'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>LITVINOFF<br /><span class='small'>Assistant Commissar of Foreign Affairs</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A well-set figure, with black eyes flashing
through a pair of thick glasses; a wealth of
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>jet black hair brushed back from a high forehead;
dark moustache and small beard; his
whole face tanned from being in the open
with the troops, he paced the platform from
one end to the other, like a caged lion.
When he spoke of the counter-revolutionary
forces his voice resounded through the hall,
filled with scorn, and his face wore a look
that was uncanny. The next moment his expression
changed, and lowering his voice he
spoke in soothing tones of the heroism and
devotion of the soldiers of the Red Army.</p>

<p class='c000'>I could understand at the end of his forty
minutes’ address what Colonel Raymond
Robins meant when he said: “Trotzky is a
great orator.” He is undoubtedly the most
convincing I have ever heard, and I have
heard many in several countries. He seems
to tug at his listeners until they find themselves
leaning forward so as not to miss a
single word. The history of this man’s life
and activities would make an interesting
book. I hope it will be written.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>CHICHERIN</h3>

<p class='c018'>As Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trotzky
was succeeded by Chicherin. He is a tall,
slightly stooped figure, about fifty years old,
with eyes that burn like coals. He is emaciated
from hunger and from hard work.
Never a day goes by but Chicherin can be
found in his office from twelve to sixteen
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>hours of the time, working with quiet determination
and zeal. I saw him in his office
at the Metropole two or three times, and was
captivated by his kind and gentle manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” he said to me, "we want peace and
are ready to conclude at once. Concessions
are still here for American capital. Leases
can be had for forty-nine years. All we ask
is that the Russian labor laws shall prevail
here and the Government shall not be interfered
with. There is flax here, and timber
and many other things that the people of
your country want.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go back to America and tell them to leave
us alone. Just let us get our breath and
turn our energies into productive work.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They all said that, Chicherin and many
other Commissars. All dwelt upon the need
for technical assistance. They look forward
to the day when they will be able to
apply the best technical and scientific experience
of the world to the solution of their
problems. They need experts in all lines and
of all grades, from simple mechanicians to
the most highly trained laboratory specialists.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>LITVINOFF</h3>

<p class='c018'>Litvinoff is a solidly built, jovial, and very
astute Lithuanian. He was one of the Collegium
in the foreign office under Chicherin,
and was the Soviet ambassador in England
after the revolution. Later he was sent back
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>to Russia by the British Government. He is
an equally shrewd business man and diplomat,
and looks more like a British member
of parliament than a Russian Bolshevik. He
has a keen sense of humor and fun, but takes
his duties very seriously. He is the type of
man often seen among directors of great enterprises
in America, putting through “big
deals.” One imagines that if he chose to sell
his services to a capitalist organization or
state he could easily become a “big man.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was my first host in Moscow, and was
very kind and helpful in giving me all the
information and assistance possible.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>MADAME KOLLONTAY</h3>

<p class='c018'>I met Madame Kollontay in the National
Hotel, three or four days after I arrived in
Moscow. She is a beautiful, cultured woman,
and an excellent speaker. She had just returned
from a tour of the southern part of
Russia, where she had been establishing
schools and organizing homes for the aged,
and informed me that the children are so
enthusiastic that they do not want to go home
when the day’s session is over. “There is a
feeling of solidarity among them,” she said.
“They are being educated without the feeling
of property of any kind. The psychology
of the people has so changed since the
revolution that the old order could not last
even if it were to be restored,” she said “and
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>if the Allies would only withdraw their armies
and stop supporting the counter-revolutionary
forces Russia could recoup herself without
outside aid of any kind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Asked about the devotion of the people to
Lenin she replied that while he was deeply
loved and respected the people were not following
him blindly, and that their devotion
was due to the fact that they realized that
he stood always for their best interests.</p>

<p class='c000'>Madame Kollontay has spent several years
in America and asked me about many of her
friends in this country. She said she hoped
to be able to return at some future time.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>MADAME BALABANOVA</h3>

<p class='c018'>Madame Balabanova, secretary of the
Third International, which has headquarters
at Moscow, is an Italian, not over five feet
tall, elderly, but full of fire and spirit. She
speaks many languages, including fluent English.
I met her on several occasions in Moscow.
She reminded me that there was
much work to be done, and that the revolution
had not ended with the overthrowing of
the old order. “We are building the new
society,” she said, “but it is slow work because
of the necessity of converting the country
into an armed camp to repel invasion,
but when the war stops we will show the
world what Soviet rule can do for the oppressed.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>She said she hoped to go back to Italy
sometime, but presumed it would be impossible,
at least until that and other countries
had recognized that the Russians and those
in sympathy with them were human beings
and not “carriers of contagion.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She is a wonderful speaker and an extremely
energetic and hard working little
woman, much admired and respected by her
colleagues.</p>

<p class='c000'>I once accompanied her on a visit to a hospital,
where she spoke to wounded soldiers.
More than two hundred convalescent soldiers
made up her audience. They lay on their
cots or sat in wheel-chairs, some of them
armless or with but one arm, others with one
leg shot off, and many with ugly head wounds.
They greeted Madame Balabanova cheerily,
and listened almost eagerly to her story of
what was going on at the front and in the
country generally. When she had finished
her address there was a silence, and then
from all the men came the deep singing of
the <cite>Internationale</cite>.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>BUCHARIN</h3>

<p class='c018'>Bucharin, a close friend and companion of
Lenin, is the editor of <cite>Pravda</cite>, the party
organ in Moscow. I learned that he, too, had
been in America for two or three months
previous to the overthrow of the Czar, and
had hurried back when this news reached
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>him. He is a small figure, always hurrying
somewhere, with a book under his arm. One
meets him in the Theater Square in the morning,
in Soviet Square a few hours later, at
the Kremlin still later, and in the evening
at the extreme opposite end of the city.
There is a saying about him, “One can never
tell where he will turn up next. He is always
on the move.” And yet he always has time
for a kindly word or question or greeting.
He is a student of history and quotes freely,
from memory, all the Russian and many
European writers.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>GEORGE MELCHOIR</h3>

<p class='c018'>George Melchoir is president of the Moscow
Central Federation of All-Russian Professional
Alliances. He worked for a long
time at Bayonne, New Jersey, but like many
others returned to Russia after the overthrow
of the Czar. He took an active part in organizing
the taking of Moscow in the early
days of the Bolshevist uprising.</p>

<p class='c000'>Melchoir has been a working man all his
life, and is extremely intelligent. The position
which he holds demands a great deal of
technical knowledge, as well as executive ability,
and every one agreed that he was thoroughly
qualified for his post. I had a long
talk with him. He was enthusiastic about
the future of Russia. It would be built
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>up, he said, by the various unions and peasant
organizations.</p>

<p class='c000'>He is probably thirty-five years of age, of
medium height, with a bulky figure, full of
vigor and enthusiasm.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>PETERS</h3>

<p class='c018'>In the early days of the revolution Peters
was chief of the Internal Defense of Petrograd.
American newspapers said of him that
“his fingers were cramped from writing
death warrants.” I asked him how many
death warrants he had signed and he told
me three hundred in all. He expressed regret
that he had been looked upon in other countries
as a murderer, and said it was unfortunate
that those people did not understand the
conditions that surrounded Russia while in
the throes of a revolution. He insisted that
the warrants he had signed had been necessary
in the interest of the country as a whole,
and that they had been signed only after investigation
and a trial of the individuals, and
that in no case had there been an execution
to gratify the personal revenge of any one.</p>

<p class='c000'>He is a Lett, very young, perhaps between
twenty-eight and thirty years old, short and
stocky, with a mass of black hair combed
straight back. He lived in England for a
number of years, and speaks the English language
easily and fluently.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
<h3 class='c017'>BORIS REINSTEIN</h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>As a former resident of Buffalo, New York,
and member of the American Socialist Labor
Party, Boris Reinstein returned to Russia
after the overthrow of the Czar. He was for
some time an assistant in the Foreign Office;
later a lecturer in a military school, and is
now an official lecturer in the large college
for training writers and speakers in Moscow.
This school was running full blast while I
was there. Classes number from seventy-five
to one hundred each. Pupils are elected by
various Soviet organizations over the country,
and at the end of six months’ training are returned
to their various communities and others
are sent into their places. The Government
supports all these pupils while they are
in training.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reinstein is an excellent speaker and a
tireless worker, and is one of the kindest and
most conscientious men I have ever met. He
is certainly not the “wild-eyed agitator” he
has been pictured in the American press. He
has given valuable service to the revolution,
though he has lost twenty-five pounds in
doing so.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>“BILL” SHATOFF</h3>

<p class='c018'>“Bill” Shatoff, described by American papers
as “the well-known anarchist,” is one of
the officials of the Soviet Army. When I was
in Petrograd he was the commander of the
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>Petrograd front. He is a big jolly Russian
Jew, and certainly does not look any the
worse for his participation in Soviet warfare,
nor for the stinted rations he has shared with
his men.</p>

  <h2 id='chap09' class='c005'>CHAPTER IX <br /> WOMEN AND CHILDREN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The Education of the children occupies
as important a place in the administration
of the Soviet Government as the maintenance
of the Red Army. The Budget for
education and child welfare is unstinted, and
at every turn one encounters evidence of actual
accomplishment in the interest of the
growing generation. “First we must defend
the workers’ state against its enemies,” said a
Commissar to me, “then we must prepare the
coming generation to carry on and develop
the state won for them by the Red Army.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the two years of the revolution 10,000
new schools had been opened. There were but
few children in Soviet Russia who are not attending
classes in grades from kindergarten
to high school. I saw few children idling indoors
or out during school hours, nor did I
see any at work in the factories. They troop
out from the schools in great bands into the
parks at recess hour. Teachers complained to
me of the lack of text-books, due to the scarcity
of paper. They resented bitterly, too, the
necessity of assembling their charges in cold
class-rooms.</p>

<p class='c000'>But in spite of meagre facilities, every
one connected with the government worked
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>hard to make every possible provision for
the care and protection of the children. The
government was feeding 359,000 children
daily in the schools in Moscow, and 200,000
in Petrograd. The most nourishing food obtainable
was requisitioned for the children.
Milk, butter and eggs went first to hospitals
and to the school restaurants, where the children
were provided with food free. Only
when there was an extra supply were healthy
adults permitted to purchase these foods.</p>

<p class='c000'>I used to watch the children, happy, robust
little folk, going from their class-rooms in
great crowds to the restaurants, where they
sat in rows at the long tables. The noon
recess lasted for two hours—one hour for
eating and one for play. The children were
chaperoned by their teachers, of whom there
were two for each roomful of pupils. One
looked after the mental studies, while the
other directed their physical training.</p>

<p class='c000'>The children of kindergarten age were
called for in the mornings by their teachers,
and were brought home by them at about
four o’clock in the afternoon. At least ninety-five
percent of the teachers were women, and
they had all received special training for
their profession.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Soviet law prohibits the employment
of children under sixteen years, except in
cases of greatest necessity. Child labor under
fourteen is forbidden. Children between
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>fourteen and eighteen permitted to enter
certain industries are not allowed to work
more than four hours a day; between sixteen
and eighteen they may work not more than
six hours daily, and all must spend two hours
in school.</p>

<p class='c000'>With much of the work of preparing meals
and the care of children of school age taken
away from them, the women of Russia were
enjoying a new freedom. They had found
themselves suddenly with time to work away
from home. They rushed into industry and
the professions and set to work with an ardor
and enthusiasm that has done much to establish
the Soviet system.</p>

<p class='c000'>Women conductors were employed on the
street-cars in all the cities in the daytime,
men being employed only at night. Women
police also were employed, and no one seemed
to think this extraordinary.</p>

<p class='c000'>Housekeepers were accorded the same right
to vote as factory workers. If a married
woman had a desire to work elsewhere than
in her home she did so, and took her meals
with her husband and friends in a Soviet
restaurant. Women shared in the discussions
in the Soviet, and were elected to offices.
Far from being “nationalized,” women were
accorded the same respect and treatment as
men.</p>

<p class='c000'>The right of inheritance has been abolished,
although dependents such as minors
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>unable to work, or invalids, are supported
out of the property of the deceased former
owner, and no discrimination is made against
children born out of wedlock.</p>

<p class='c000'>The government recognizes only civil marriages,
but an additional religious ceremony
is optional with the contracting parties and
is not restricted in any way by the government.
An oral or written statement of the
parties desiring to contract the marriage is
required by the nearest Department of Registration.
Boys under eighteen and girls under
sixteen are prohibited from marrying, and
the laws of consanguinity in force in other
countries are observed in Russia also. Births
must be registered in the Department of
Registration nearest the mother’s residence,
and children born out of wedlock have the
same status as those born of a registered
union.</p>

<p class='c000'>Divorces are granted on the petition of
either or both parties. When the petition is
mutual the persons are obliged to state what
surnames the children of the marriage are
expected to bear in future. In case only
one party petitions, the surname of the children
and the responsibility for maintenance
are decided by the judge.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Moscow I visited a lying-in hospital
under the Division of Motherhood and Infants,
of the Department of Social Welfare.
This was one of many similar institutions
this department had established in all the
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>large and many of the small cities. Here
the working women receive care and nourishment
without cost for several weeks
before and after child-birth. They have the
best food and medical treatment obtainable,
and are paid their full wages during the time
they are out of their accustomed employment.
In connection with this hospital in Moscow,
which was established in an imposing white
stone structure formerly an <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">élite</span></em> finishing
school where the daughters of the rich learned
French and the gentle arts, there was a
training college where five hundred young
women, chosen by various trade and peasant
organizations throughout the country, were
attending a six months’ course of lectures and
practical demonstrations on obstetrics and the
care of children. Already three classes of
five hundred each had been graduated and
sent back to their respective communities to
apply their experience and to train others.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moving pictures were shown daily, portraying
to the mothers the best methods of
bathing, dressing, and caring for their infants,
and these were supplemented with lectures.
Older children of working mothers
were cared for during the day in government
nurseries, where they were given the best
possible care and attention.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following is a table showing the record
of the accomplishments in this department in
the year 1919.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>More than 2,500 libraries had been established
throughout the country since the revolution.
All the larger towns have their high
schools, technical schools, and musical conservatories.</p>

<p class='c000'>As every able-bodied adult must work in
Soviet Russia, I wondered who went to the
advanced technical schools. Each local Soviet
elected its group of students to attend schools
for special training for terms varying from
three to six months. At the end of the training
the students returned to their communities
to teach, and a new group was sent for
similar training. The schools were free; the
students were furnished with food, clothing,
living quarters and books, and were provided
with tickets for theatres, concerts and other
entertainments. All students were granted
loans, to be used for spending money while in
school, if they preferred to purchase their own
clothing and other necessaries. In Moscow
the average loan was 1,200 rubles, varying
according to the rise or fall of the ruble’s
value.</p>

<p class='c000'>Throughout the country homes for the aged
had been established where men over sixty
and women over fifty were cared for by the
government, provided they did not have children
or relatives who wished to keep them in
their own homes. In the latter case they were
given adequate pensions.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I found less of the “institution” atmosphere
in these homes than in those I have
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>seen in other countries. Books, pictures, a
meeting-room, and dining-room, and a general
atmosphere of comfort and freedom
seemed to make the elderly people content
and happy. They are not considered “paupers”
or “charges on the state,” but human
beings who have contributed their service to
society and are entitled to all the peace and
comfort society can give them.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have dwelt upon the organization and
spirit of the Red Army and upon the education
and care of the children more than upon
anything else, because these are the things
that made the strongest impression upon me
during my stay in Soviet Russia. They stand
out above all else in the memory of weeks
crowded with a multitude of rapid and various
observations. The soldiers and the children
come first in the consideration of the
government. Here the greatest ingenuity and
energy have been applied, and here the best
results are evident. It has been the purpose
of the Soviet leaders to make the first line of
defense—the army—unconquerable. Government
officials claim they have succeeded in
this, and point to the map as evidence. The
children, they say, are the strategical reserves
of the communist state. They are aiming to
keep them healthy in body, despite the privations
imposed by the blockade, and to develop
them mentally and physically to carry on the
future state. No one can deny the large measure
of success realized.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>THE SOVIET STATE</h3>

<p class='c018'>The All-Russian Congress of Soviets is
composed of representatives of urban
Soviets, one delegate for 25,000 voters, and of
rural Soviets, one delegate for 125,000 inhabitants.
This Congress is convoked at
least twice a year. There had already been
six meetings. The Congress elects an All-Russian
Central Executive Committee of not
more than two hundred members, which is the
supreme power of the republic, in all periods
between convocations of the Congress. It directs
in a general way the activities of the
Workers’ and Peasants’ Government, considers
and enacts all measures or proposals
introduced by the Soviet of Peoples’ Commissars,
convokes the Congress of Soviets, and
forms a Council of People’s Commissars.
This council in turn is entrusted with the general
management of the affairs of the republic
and in this capacity issues decrees, resolutions
and orders, notifying the Central Executive
Committee immediately of all such orders or
decrees.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>There are seventeen of these Commissars,
(1) Foreign Affairs, (2) Army, (3) Navy,
(4) Interior, (5) Justice, (6) Labor, (7) Social
Welfare, (8) Education, (9) Post and
Telegraph, (10) National Affairs, (11) Finances,
(12) Ways of Communication, (13)
Agriculture, (14) Commerce and Industry,
(15) National Supplies, (16) Supreme Soviet
of National Economy, (17) Public Health.
Each Commissar has a collegium, or committee,
the members of which are appointed by
the Council of People’s Commissars, of which
body Lenin is the president.</p>

<p class='c000'>These committees act as the administrators
of the nation, dealing with ratification and
amendments to the constitution; the general
interior and foreign policy of the
republic; boundaries; the admission or secessions
of new members; the establishing or
changing of weights, measures, or money
denominations; declarations of war or peace
treaties; loans, commercial agreements or
treaties; taxes; military affairs; legislation
and judicial procedure; civil and criminal
procedure; and citizenship.</p>

<p class='c000'>Local affairs are administered by local
Soviets, in the following order: Rural Soviets,
of ten or less than ten members, send one delegate
to the rural congress, which in turn sends
one delegate for each ten of its members to
the County Soviet Congress. This County
Soviet Congress sends one delegate for each
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>1,000 inhabitants (though not more than three
hundred in all may be sent) to the Provincial
Soviet Congress, which is made up of representatives
of both urban and rural Soviets.
The Provincial Soviet Congress sends from
its body one representative for 10,000 inhabitants
of the rural districts, and one for each
2,000 voters in the city, to the Regional Soviet
Congress. This Congress sends one delegate
for each 125,000 inhabitants to the All-Russian
Congress of Soviets.</p>

<p class='c000'>All these Congresses of Soviets elect their
own executive committees for handling local
affairs, but in small rural districts questions
are decided at general meetings of the
voters whenever possible. The functions of
the local Congresses of Soviets and deputies
are given thus in the Constitution: To carry
out all orders of the respective higher organs
of the Soviet Power; to take all steps for
raising the cultural and economic standard of
the given territory; to decide all questions
of local importance within their respective
territories; and to coordinate all Soviet activity
in their respective territories.</p>

<p class='c000'>Roughly speaking, the Supreme Council
of National Economy, which is established
under the Council of the People’s Commissars,
deals with the organization and distribution
of production. It coordinates the activities
of the federal and the local Soviets,
and has the right of confiscation, requisition,
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>or compulsory syndication of various
branches of industry and commerce; it determines
the amount of raw materials and fuel
needed, obtains and distributes them, and organizes
and supplies the rural economy. It
works in close and constant touch with the
All-Russian Professional Alliances, and under
its direction the latter constantly regulates
the wage scales in accordance with the rise
and fall of prices of commodities. When I
was in Moscow the average wage paid was
3,000 rubles per month, and in Petrograd
3,500. A member of the Council of People’s
Commissars received 4,500 per month, out of
which he had to pay rent and buy food and
clothing. Lenin, as president, received the
same amount, which was equivalent to about
$180 in American money.</p>

<p class='c000'>All men and women of the republic belonging
to the following classes are allowed to
vote after their eighteenth year: Individuals
doing productive or useful work; all
persons engaged in housekeeping which enables
others to do productive work; peasants
who employ no help in agricultural labor;
soldiers of the army and sailors of the navy;
citizens who are incapacited for work; and
foreigners who live in and are working for
the republic.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suffrage and candidacy are denied to persons
who employ labor in order to obtain
profits; persons who live on an income, such
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>as interest from capital, receipts from property,
etc.; private merchants, trade or commercial
brokers; monks and clergy of all
denominations;<a id='rA' /><a href='#fA' class='c026'><sup>[A]</sup></a> employees and agents of the
former police, gendarmes, or secret service;
persons under legal guardianship, or who
have been declared by law as demented or
mentally deficient; and persons who have
been deprived of their rights of citizenship
by a Soviet, for selfish or dishonorable
offences for the term fixed by the Soviet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Church has been separated from the
State and the School from the Church, but the
right of religious or anti-religious propaganda
is accorded to every citizen. The government
press has been freed from all dependence
upon capital in the form of advertising,
and all the technical and material
means for publication, as well as for the publication
of books and pamphlets are free.
Furnished halls, with heating and lighting
free, are given to the poorest peasantry for
meeting-places.</p>

<hr class='c027' />
<div class='footnote' id='fA'>
<p class='c000'><span class='label'><a href='#rA'>A</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There have been some modifications of this regulation
recently. I have heard since my return to America that clergymen
are given the right to vote provided they are supported by
the workers and not from endowments.</p>

1917, was replaced in September, 1918, by
“The Fundamental Law of Socialization of
the Land,” which has already been enforced
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>throughout the country except in the cases of
land owned by peasants and worked by the
owner and his family. This land decree has
been enforced gradually, and perhaps less
completely than any other of the Soviet
decrees, first because the energies of the Government
were diverted to a war of defence,
and secondly, because the land question would
naturally take the longest to settle even in
times of peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>The land decree provides that all property
rights in land, minerals, oil, gas, peat, medicinal
springs, waters, timber and other natural
resources be abolished and the land given
to the use of the entire laboring population,
without open or secret compensation to former
owners. The right to use this land belongs
to those who till it by their own labor,
and is not restricted by sex, religion, nationality,
or foreign citizenship. Under-surface
deposits, timber, etc., are at the disposal of
the Soviet powers, local or federal, and all
live stock and agricultural implements are to
be taken over without indemnification by the
land departments of the Soviets. Infants,
or minors, cripples, invalids, or aged persons
who would be deprived of their means of subsistence
by the enforcement of this decree
are pensioned either for life or until they
attain their majority. Minors are given the
same pension as soldiers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Land may be used for cultural and educational
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>purposes; for agricultural purposes,
communities, associations, village organizations,
individuals and families; and for industrial,
commercial and transportation enterprises
under the control of the Soviet
power. It is given to those who wish to
work it for themselves, to local agricultural
workers whose plots are now too small, or who
have been employed by land owners, and to
immigrants who come from towns or cities in
order to work on the land.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the land was turned over to the peasants
each one seized the opportunity to establish
his own little homestead. Since that time
the peasants have discovered the benefits of
cooperative agricultural production, and have
established their own agricultural communes
all over the country.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>LABOR LAWS</h3>

<p class='c018'>The Soviet Russian Code of Labor Laws
passed by the Russian Central Executive
Committee in 1919 covers the whole field of
Russian labor activities. To workers in other
countries some of the provisions will appear
drastic, but it must be remembered that
Russia is still an armed camp and that
the war has disorganized industry, transportation
and almost every other form of endeavor.
I was informed that every effort was
being made under these laws to coordinate
the productive forces of the country with a
view to securing the highest possible production
for the pressing needs of the Russian
people. When the war stops, as it no doubt
will in the immediate future, Soviet Russia
will be faced with the problem of diverting
into productive channels its three million
soldiers, as well as other millions now engaged
directly or indirectly in the war. Just as we
had our “Work or Fight” measures in this
country for the purpose of utilizing the nation’s
human energy in a profitable way in
time of stress, so in Soviet Russia every effort
is being made to place the workers where the
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>greatest results to the nation as a whole will
accrue.</p>

<p class='c000'>In connection with the passage of these
labor laws, it must be borne in mind that the
working people in Soviet Russia enjoy much
more control at the present time than do the
same class of people in possibly any other
country. One must take into consideration
the fact that these laws were initiated by the
unions themselves or their representatives,
who shared jointly with the political side of
the Government the responsibility for maintaining
the new order. Many of the former
so-called bourgeoisie of the old regime, I was
informed, have spent the past two years doing
nothing but live by speculation and they
stir up trouble on the slightest pretext
against the new Government. It was primarily
to reach recalcitrants of this character
that the compulsory provisions were inserted
in the code. The result of the passage of
these laws did not, so far as I could judge,
diminish the enthusiasm of the Russian
workers for the new order, but on the other
hand their energy seems to have been stimulated,
no doubt because they were beginning
to feel that through their various organizations
this step had been taken for the express
purpose of forcing into production every
man and woman in the country capable of
producing and helping to reconstruct Russia.</p>

<p class='c000'>Article I of the code deals with compulsory
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>labor. It provides that all citizens of the
Soviet Republic, with the following exceptions,
are subject to compulsory labor:</p>

<p class='c000'>First, persons under sixteen years of age;
second, all persons over fifty years of age;
third, persons who have become incapacitated
by injury or illness; fourth, women for a period
of eight weeks before and eight weeks
after confinement.</p>

<p class='c000'>All students are subject to compulsory
labor at the schools. Labor conditions in all
establishments, Soviet, nationalized, public
and private, are regulated by tariff rules
drafted by the trade unions in agreement
with the directors or owners of establishments
and enterprises and approved by the people’s
commissariat of labor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Article II, entitled “The Right to Work,”
provides that all citizens able to work have
the right to employment at their vocations
and remuneration fixed for such class of
work. The district exchange bureaus of the
Department of Labor Distribution, in agreement
with respective unions, assign individual
wage earners or groups of them to work at
other trades if there is no demand for labor
at the vocation of the persons in question.
All persons of the female sex and those of
the male sex under eighteen years of age have
no right to work at night or in those industries
in which the conditions of labor are especially
hard or dangerous.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>Article III, provides for the methods of
labor distribution. Any wage earner who is
not engaged on work at his vocation shall register
at the Local Department of Labor Distribution
as unemployed. An unemployed person
has no right to refuse an offer of work
at his vocation, providing the working conditions
conform with the standards fixed by the
respective tariff regulations, or, in the absence
of the same, by the trades unions. An
unemployed person who is offered work outside
his vocation shall be obliged to accept it
on the understanding, if he so wishes, that
this be only until he receives work at his
vocation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Article V, makes provision for the transfer
of a wage earner to other work within the
enterprise, establishment or institution where
he is employed. His transfer may be ordered
by the managing authorities of said enterprise,
establishment or institution. The decision
of the Department of Labor in the matter
of a transfer of labor may be appealed from
under the law by the interested parties to the
District Department of Labor or to the
People’s Commissariat of Labor, whose decision
of the matter in dispute is final. In case
of urgent public work the Department of
Labor, in agreement with the respective professional
unions, may order the transfer of a
whole group of wage earners from the organization
where they are employed to another
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>situated in the same or a different locality.
This is done, provided a sufficient number of
volunteers for such work cannot be found.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under Article VI, which covers remuneration
of labor, the law provides that in working
out tariff rates and determining the
standard rates of remuneration all wage
earners of a trade shall be divided into
groups of skill, and a definite standard of remuneration
shall be fixed for each group.
In determining the standard of remuneration
for each category, consideration must be
given to the kind of labor, the danger of the
conditions under which the work is performed,
the complexity and accuracy of the
work. Remuneration for piece-work is computed
by dividing the daily tariff rate by the
number of pieces constituting the production
standard. Remuneration for overtime work
shall not exceed time and a half. During
illness of a wage earner the remuneration due
him shall be paid as a subsidy from the hospital
fund. The unemployed receive a subsidy
out of the funds for unemployed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under Article VII, which deals with working
hours, provision is made that the duration
of a normal working day must in no case
exceed eight hours for day work and seven
hours for night work, and that the duration
of a normal day, first, for persons under eighteen
years of age, and second, for persons
working in especially hard or health-endangering
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>branches of industry, must not exceed
six hours. In case the nature of the work is
such that it requires a working day in excess
of the normal, two or more shifts shall be
engaged. Except in extreme cases work in
excess of the normal hours, or what is usually
called overtime work, is not permitted. No
females and no males under eighteen years of
age may do any overtime work, and the time
spent by those on such work in the course of
two consecutive days must not exceed four
hours. All wage earners must be allowed a
weekly uninterrupted rest of not less than
forty-two hours, and on the eve of rest days
the normal working day is reduced by two
hours. Every wage earner who has worked
without interruption not less than six months
shall be entitled to leave of absence for two
weeks, and every wage earner who has
worked without interruption not less than a
year shall be entitled to leave of absence for
not less than one month with full pay.</p>

<p class='c000'>Article VIII deals with methods to insure
efficiency of labor. The standard output for
wage earners of each trade and group is fixed
by valuation commissions of the respective
trades unions. This article provides that a
wage earner systematically producing less
than the fixed standard may be transferred
by the decision of the proper valuation commission
to other work in the same group and
category, or to a lower group or category
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>with a corresponding reduction of wages.
However, appeal can be taken from this provision
of the law as well as all other provisions
in the code.</p>

<p class='c000'>Article IX provides for protection of life,
health and labor of persons engaged in any
economic activity, and the carrying out of
this part of the law is entrusted to labor
inspectors, technical inspectors and the
representatives of sanitary inspection. The
labor inspection is under the jurisdiction of
the People’s Commissariat of Labor and its
local branches, which are the Departments of
Labor, and is composed of labor inspectors,
elected by the councils of professional unions.
The inspectors are compelled under the law
to visit at any time of the day or night all the
industrial enterprises of their district and all
places where work is carried on, as well as
places provided for the workmen by the enterprises,
such as rooming-houses, asylums,
baths, etc., and to assist the trades unions and
works committee in their efforts to ameliorate
in individual enterprises as well as in
branches of industry.</p>

<p class='c000'>This brief outline of the Code of Labor
Laws, the full text of which will be found in
the appendix, shows how thoroughly the new
régime in Russia has gone into the question
of organizing the labor power of the
country for production on the highest scale.
I was told over and over again by various
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>officials of the labor organizations of Soviet
Russia and the Government officials as well,
that what they were interested in above all
else at the present time was the organization
of labor along lines that would insure sufficient
production of essential commodities to
meet the needs of all the people under Soviet
rule.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>TRANSPORTATION</h3>

<p class='c018'>Before the war there were in Russia 37,000
railway locomotives. At the end of the war
13,000 were left. Of these, at the time of the
Brest Litovsk treaty, thirty-five percent were
disabled. In the spring of 1919 the total number
of disabled locomotives amounted to fifty
percent. Since that time there has been some
improvement, and last August only forty-seven
percent of them were disabled. There is
a great demand for locomotives. Russia could
use to advantage the entire product of the
United States for the next six years. Approximately
the same conditions prevail with
reference to cars.</p>

<p class='c000'>Practically the whole transportation system
was given over to the movement of troops
and army supplies. In certain sections of
the country there was a surplus of grain, but
no facilities to transport it to the cities.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the last stage of the journey to Moscow
I had a vivid glimpse into the transportation
problem of Soviet Russia. Two or three hours
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>out of Smolensk we stopped at a small way
station and hooked on seventeen cars loaded
with wood intended to relieve the critical fuel
shortage in Moscow. After five or six hours’
journey, with only brief stops, the train made
a prolonged halt. I got out to learn the cause
of the delay. The cars loaded with wood had
been uncoupled from the train and men were
busy throwing the billets into the field by the
track. The station was crowded with soldiers.
Word had been received to rush reinforcements
southward to meet the advance of
Denikin. These cars were needed to carry
the troops.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What about the wood?” I asked, “Isn’t it
needed in Moscow?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” was the reply. “The nights are
getting very cold in Moscow. But Moscow
must wait. The army comes first.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Such incidents were happening daily,
hourly, no doubt, all over Russia. Always,
they complained, the necessities of the war
and the mobilization hampered the productive
enterprises of the nation.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>INDUSTRY</h3>

<p class='c018'>While I was in Moscow the Government
received a report from the Supreme Council
of National Economy to the effect that war
industry was progressing at full speed and
producing sufficient supplies and ammunitions
for the army. In addition the departments
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>of building materials, fur, leather, fuel,
metal, chemicals, and trade, had been organized.
There were fifty-one factories in the
building material branch alone, capable of
producing 121,500,000 bricks, 2,000,000 poods
of cement, 870,000 poods of lime, and 510,000
poods of tiles. The tanneries were running
on the basis of 240,800 poods annually. The
department of forests had obtained a contract
for twenty percent of the fuel demand,
in the Moscow Government alone. There were
sixty-eight saw mills and 128 planing mills
running on full time. All paper factories
were working. The chemical department controls
the paper, china, and chemical production.
The trade department supervised 175,000
workers and had its own art industry
museum.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Government is planning the construction
of enormous power systems, one of which
will be the largest in the world. They will
also utilize the water falls for great hydraulic
power stations, all of which would require
great amounts of machinery from America.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>CANALS</h3>

<p class='c018'>The Volga and Don canal will connect the
Black and Caspian Seas and the Volga river
with the Baltic Sea. Canal Dredges are
needed to build these.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>
<h3 class='c017'>RAW MATERIALS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>There are at present in warehouses in Russia
200,000 tons of flax, the present market
price of which, in London, is over $1,000 per
ton. There are also 100,000 tons of hemp.
There is gold, timber, and ninety percent of
the world’s supply of platinum.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many factories will be erected, great rolling
mills, steel mills, etc. There is no doubt but
that Russia will eventually be able to produce
everything it needs. The country is thoroughly
stocked with all kinds of mineral
products and it is merely a matter of time
before it will be entirely independent. It
struck me that in the meantime the American
business men are missing a wonderful opportunity
in these ready markets for their
machinery and equipment. Russia will be, in
the course of a very few years, a very strong
competitor, whereas now it offers a vast
market.</p>

  <h2 id='chap11' class='c005'>CHAPTER XI <br /> PROPAGANDA</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>On my way into Red Russia the train on
which I was travelling passed, between
Rejistza and Novo-Sokoliev, a train of ten or
twelve cars, the sides of which were covered
with huge, multi-colored placards. It was
the “Lenin Train” used for carrying propaganda
literature all over the republic. When
I saw it, it was on a tour of the country behind
the Western Front.</p>

<p class='c000'>The train was decorated with great paintings
in bright colors and with revolutionary
inscriptions. In one of the cars was a moving
picture apparatus and screen; another
was fitted up as a book shop; and a third as a
telegraph station which posted the latest news
bulletins at every station, and circulated news
from the front and from the rest of the
world. The train carried representatives
from government departments and a staff of
speakers and lecturers.</p>

<p class='c000'>It had been in constant service for about
two months, during which time it travelled
through the districts of Pskov, Vitebsk, Lettonia,
White Russia, Lithuania, and Kharkov,
covering some 3,590 versts. In all the
stations and towns through which it passed,
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>leaflets, pamphlets and books were distributed.
Meetings were arranged and lectures given,
and the Commissary representatives visited
the Soviet institutions offering suggestions
and aid. Workers and peasants assembled
about the train and listened to speeches made
from the roofs of cars and gathered bundles
of literature to be distributed in the villages
and workshops. They told of their difficulties
to the speakers and asked them for their advice.</p>

<p class='c000'>In America I had always heard so much
about the illiteracy of the Russian peasants
that I wondered what use quantities of reading
matter would be to them. I discovered
that illiteracy was not nearly so general as
popularly supposed, and was decreasing
rapidly under the government’s energetic
educational program. In every community
there is at least one who can read and write.
Russians live in villages everywhere; even on
the plains or steppes such a thing as an isolated
farmhouse or workman’s cottage is rare.
The farmer may, and often does, have to go
some distance to work his land, but his home
is always among other homes. When literatures
arrives those who can, read aloud. The
others gather around the reader to listen.
Long discussions, so dearly loved by the Russians,
follow.</p>

<p class='c000'>The “Lenin Train” was preceded by telegraphic
announcements of its coming, so
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>there was a crowd to meet it at every station.
Sometimes the reception was very ceremonious.
At Rejistza, where it arrived at
night, it was met with banners, music and
torches. At a tiny station, Malinooka, a
crowd of peasants from the nearby villages
was waiting to receive their literature and
“to hear directly from the seat of their government.”
I learned that five more similar
trains were being prepared to be put on the
Volga and its tributaries, and motor-trucks
to be sent into the sections where neither railways
nor waterways entered. One was to be
called “The October Revolution,” another
“The Communist,” and a third “The Red
Army.” The others were not yet named.
Boats too were used for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was easy to understand why these people,
beset on all sides, were carrying on propaganda
to defend their country. But I found
that their propaganda did not end with this
defensive material. By far the greater proportion
of it was what might be called cultural.
It was intended not only to waken the
people to a realization that their own lives
were threatened, but to teach them that they
were a part of the great world that lay outside
their own land. The art, the music, the
literature and the science of the world was
brought to them in simple form so that
they could comprehend it and be stimulated
to further reading and study. Whatever
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>else the Russians may be they are not materialistic.
I found them more eager for news
and knowledge than for food, of which they
got so little. Whatever news is obtained from
the outside world is disseminated at once, by
telegraph and bulletins, to all parts of the
country.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the town of Praele a Bolshevist soldier
said to me with a twinkle in his eye, “You
have a great country in America.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why do you think it a great country?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are shooting negroes in Chicago and
Washington now,” was his answer; “and
that’s the country that talks about Soviet
Russia being barbarous.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Naturally I was interested in the confirmation
or refutation of the reports I had heard,
that the Bolsheviki intend to spread their
propaganda all over the world. Soviet officials
talked frankly to me about prisoners
and propaganda. They liked to take prisoners,
they said. They only wished they had
more food so that they could afford to take
more of them. They didn’t want them to
starve. They would like to take a million
prisoners a day if they had enough food and
paper. “After all,” they said, “our war is
primarily a war of education.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At many points along the battlefronts
I saw great banners stretched between
posts, with letters large enough to be read
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>a hundred yards away, telling the other
side what the war was about. One, which I
had translated for me on the Lettish front,
read, “The Germans are marching on Riga.
German soldiers are helping you to destroy
the working class republic in Russia. If you
want to defend Lettland go back and drive
the Germans out of Riga.” The Russians
placed great reliance on this battlefront propaganda.
I found evidence in the Lettish
ranks of the effectiveness of these tactics.</p>

<p class='c000'>In striking contrast to the enthusiasm of
the Soviet officials for this propaganda at the
fighting front, and their reliance upon it to
achieve important military results, was their
seeming indifference to propaganda abroad.
They were anxious enough that the case for
the Russian revolution and the Soviet Government
should be presented to the people of
other countries, but they displayed none of
that eager confidence in their ability to stir
revolution abroad with which they are commonly
credited. They believed that by means
of propaganda they could break the morale
of any army brought against them; but they
did not pretend to be able to subvert remote
governments. They were amused by the fear
of Bolshevik propaganda displayed in the
foreign press. They were not inclined to rate
their powers so highly. “To be sure,” they
told me, “we are internationalists and revolutionists,
but if other countries are not ready
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>for revolution how can we stimulate it? That
is not our job. We have had our revolution in
Russia and we must bend all our energies to
preserve it. The workers in other countries
must take care of their own affairs.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>They were willing to give guarantees that
the Soviet Government would not engage in
revolutionary propaganda abroad. They told
me that they had repeatedly assured foreign
journalists and agents that their governments
could take any measures they saw fit to protect
themselves against Russian propaganda.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of propaganda in Russia itself there is
plenty. I have already described the propaganda
among prisoners of war, and of its
effect upon the English prisoners in Moscow.
I have no doubt the same “torture” was administered
to Americans in Siberia. I saw,
in an American magazine, a statement of
a Canadian soldier that he and many of his
comrades had been entirely converted to the
doctrines of Bolshevism, but he attributed his
conversion to actual experiences and to the
things he saw rather than to anything he had
read or been told. It occurs to an unprejudiced
observer who has been in Soviet Russia
that the nations that feared the contagion of
Bolshevist propaganda took the worst possible
way of avoiding it when they sent their young
soldiers into a land full of propaganda explaining
and upholding the new order established
there.</p>

  <h2 id='chap12' class='c005'>CHAPTER XII <br /> COMING OUT OF SOVIET RUSSIA</h2>
</div>

<p class='c014'>I was checked and guarded out of Red
Russia in the same manner in which I
had been checked and guarded into it. When
I was ready to leave Petrograd, early in October,
Zinovieff delegated as my guard and
guide a short, stocky Esthonian, Isaac Mikkal.
As Grafman had reminded me of
Larkin, so Mikkal reminded me of Tom
Hickey, the famous Texas socialist. He appeared
rather pleased at my calling him
“Hickey” which I did, throughout the journey.</p>

<p class='c000'>We left Petrograd at eleven o’clock at
night, and arrived at Pskov the next morning
at eight, where we had to remain until five in
the evening before we could get a train for
Rejistza, which we reached at six the following
day. Here the division commandant
stamped our papers and sent us on to Velikie
Luki to the headquarters of the army command.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hickey” had turned out to be a less
aggressive and efficient guide than Larkin,
and as he could give me little information
about either the country we were passing
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>through or the events that were taking place,
I longed often for my old friend whom I had
left at Moscow weeks before. With our papers
stamped at Velikie Luki, we were allowed
to go on to the front without going
through Smolensk, and I asked the commandant
to give me a guide who understood that
part of the Western Front, so that I could
proceed more swiftly. He granted this request,
but said that “Hickey” must also be of
the party, since he had been charged at Petrograd
with my safe delivery and must make
his report on his return to that city. After
a brief telephone conversation, in Russian,
the commandant informed me that another
guide would appear in less than a half hour.
We had dinner and waited calmly. At the
end of the stipulated time my guide entered,
and to my surprise and pleasure it was
“Larkin.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He stopped short, looked at me a moment,
raised his hands to his head and brushed off
his cap which fell to the floor. “God love a
duck, is it you? They told me there was a
journalist here who wanted to go to the front
but if I had known it was you I would have
said I was laid up with cholera.”</p>

<p class='c000'>I introduced my two guides and we went
to the station, only to find that the train we
had expected to take at eleven that night
would not go before five the next morning.
There was nothing to do but climb in one of
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>the coaches, but since the train was already
full of soldiers, talking, singing, and smoking,
there was but little sleep for me that night.</p>

<p class='c000'>At five in the morning we started—on time
at last. The conductor informed me that we
would reach Rejistza at five in the afternoon,
but we did not arrive until four in the
morning. I endeavored to learn from both
“Larkin” and “Hickey” the real reason for
the delay, but they told me to “forget it. A
few hours’ delay makes no difference to you,
one way or the other.” At last “Larkin”
must have grown very weary of my importunities.
At any rate he said, “Please remember
you are in Russia and that we are at war.
All trains are soldier trains. They must stop
to take on soldiers and to let soldiers off. They
must stop to make repairs. They must stop
for many reasons. Don’t imagine you are
in America, on an express train. Some time
when the war is over trains will run on time,
but now,—well stop kicking.” I stopped.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Rejistza we learned that we must wait
until four <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> for a train going to the
Dvinsk front. In the division commandant’s
office we found two foreigners who had come
across the front the night before. They
were on the way to Moscow, and were being
checked in as I had been. The commandant
asked “Larkin,” whom he knew quite well,
if he would take them to Velikie Luki;
and on “Larkin’s” saying that he had been
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>entrusted with the task of seeing me to the
front, the commandant told him that “Hickey”
could see me through. I was sorry to lose
“Larkin,” but there was nothing else to be
done, and we parted with a cordial wish that
we might meet again under more favorable
circumstances. “But, God love a duck,—I
hope you stay out of Russia until peace
comes,” were his last words to me.</p>

<p class='c000'>When “Hickey” and I finally reached
Dvinsk the Poles were shelling the town.
The soldier train on which I was traveling
stopped two miles outside the city and the
soldiers detrained and began marching into
Dvinsk to reinforce their comrades. I did
not wish to go through Dvinsk. One experience
under shell-fire had been sufficiently
shocking to my nervous system, and it wasn’t
my war at any rate. I protested to “Hickey”
that he had been instructed to see me <em>safely</em>
across the front, and demanded that he take
me to some other point where I could cross.
He told me that the papers read that I was to
pass through the Dvinsk front. I said that,
papers to the contrary notwithstanding, I
refused to cross at Dvinsk. Poor “Hickey”
crossed to an officer and held a discussion,
during which he made a few notes. At the
conclusion of their talk he returned to me
“If you <em>won’t</em> go this way,” he told me, “we
will have to go back on this train seventy-five
versts and then drive ten versts across country
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>to the thirty-second division command to
get your papers amended. Then you’ll have
to return to the same station, wait for a train,
ride forty versts, get off and drive twenty-two
versts across country to the brigade command
of this division, and then from there we will
have to drive twenty versts more to the Soviet
outposts, where you can get into the neutral
zone and start for the Lettish outposts seventeen
versts away.”</p>

<p class='c000'>All my former desire for speedy travel
and short cuts seemed to have evaporated.
I yielded meekly to this decree and was, I
believe, fairly patient during the two days
it took us to carry out this long program.
When we finally arrived at the Soviet front
I was told to start down the road and walk
seventeen versts, which would bring me into
Lettish territory. Again my suitcase was
heavy, or rather it was still heavy, and I protested
that I could not walk so far and carry
it. But no vehicles were available in that part
of the country. My officer informant pointed
to a village two or three versts away, across
a field, and said: “When you get to that
village you may be able to hire a hay-rick.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Even that comparatively short walk did
not appear attractive, but at this particular
moment there came around a bend in the
road an old Russian driving a familiar
hay-rick. He readily consented to take me
to the village, and after saying farewell to
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>“Hickey,” and enjoining him to “keep smiling,”
my aged saviour and I set out on our
journey. A half hour later, in the village, I
tried my best, with my still limited Russian
vocabulary, to procure another hay-rick to
drive me the fourteen versts remaining between
me and the Lettish front. Out of the
crowd of villagers that surrounded me there
emerged a Lettish boy of perhaps fifteen
years, who told me in German that he would
take me across. When the villagers understood
what I wanted, the peasant women insisted
that I must have food before starting. I
was taken into one of the dingy little homes,
where I was served with good rye bread, butter,
milk, and eggs, which I ate greedily, I
am afraid, for I was very hungry. Not even
the thousands of flies that I had to brush
away before I could take a bite prevented
my enjoyment of this food.</p>

<p class='c000'>At seven in the evening my boy rescuer
and I reached the Lettish front, this time in
a hay-rick <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de luxe</span></em>, with straw and an old
quilt on the slats of the floor. The Lettish
officers examined me again, and told me that
if I would take a hay-rick and drive twenty-two
versts to the Kreisberg station I could
take a train at two in the morning that would
bring me to Riga early the next afternoon.
They gave me food, produced a hay-rick, and,
half frozen but safe, I reached Kreizberg
and finally Riga, at one the next afternoon.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>Feeling secure at last, I left the station at
Riga and proceeded up the street towards
the De Rome Hotel. I noticed an aeroplane
circling overhead, but I had grown so accustomed
to war manœuvers that I disregarded
it entirely. About two squares further on
my way I heard a terrific crash and explosion
and turned to see smoke rising from the
station I had just left. A German aeroplane
had bombed the station, killing seven people
and injuring fourteen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Arrived at the hotel, I asked the proprietor
what was wrong. He told me that the Germans
were marching on the town, and shelling
it as they marched, and that 60,000 of
them were just across the river.</p>

<p class='c000'>My only thought was that I wanted to get
out at once. “You can’t go,” he said.
“There are no boats running and the German
army<a id='rC' /><a href='#fC' class='c026'><sup>[C]</sup></a> controls the railroad to Mitau.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Apparently it was as dangerous to come
out to civilization as it had been to go into
“barbarous” Soviet Russia. I recalled the
peace and the kindness I had found inside
that supposedly violent land with a great
longing.</p>

<p class='c000'>That afternoon I went to the Lettish
Foreign Office to visit the officials who had
granted me permission to enter a few weeks
before. They appeared glad to see me, but
incredulous as to my identity. Was I sure
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>that I had been safely through Russia? Was
I still in the flesh or merely a very vigorous
and somewhat pugnacious ghost? My young
friend who had been so concerned was very
eager to know what I had seen. I told him I
could indeed confirm his worst fears. The
Bolsheviki were people who had but little
respect for the sacred rights of private property.
I hastened to make my escape before
he could ask me about the nationalization of
women. I did not want to disappoint him
too much.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day all the guests of the hotel
were locked in and forbidden to leave the
hotel. The Lettish staff officers were established
in the hotel, two doors away from my
room. Two regiments of Esthonians reached
Riga that day and their first act was to place
a big field-gun immediately in front of the
hotel and begin firing over the roof of it into
the German position. Knowing the reputation
of the Germans for finding gun positions,
I was not very sanguine over the
prospects of my safe return to America. The
shelling lasted for forty-eight hours, during
which time the deafening noise and the jarring
of the walls made rest impossible.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Danish Consul and his staff occupied
the rooms immediately across the hall from
mine. The third day they invited me over to
lunch with them in their room, as Lettish
soldiers had been billeted in the dining-room
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>downstairs. About four in the afternoon,
after the wine had all been consumed, the
Danes began singing the songs of their own
country. Scarcely an hour later the door of
the room was opened and five Lettish officers
marched in, ordering us all to “Get your
clothes together and get ready.” The Danish
Consul asked what they meant. “You have
been drinking the health of Germany and
singing German songs. Yon are under arrest,”
was the answer.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was somewhat disappointed when they
apologized after we had shown them our
papers. Arrest and deportation to other
shores seemed very attractive to me just then.</p>

<p class='c000'>A little later the proprietor came in and
told us that food was getting scarce, that
prices had doubled, and that we would have
to pay in Czarist rubles, since the Lettish
rubles (which he had been glad to take before)
were no longer any good. After we had
organized a vigorous protest he recanted and
we had no further difficulty on that score.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day Michael Farbman of the
<cite>Chicago Tribune</cite>, with G. G. Desmond of the
<cite>London Daily News</cite>, dropped in from somewhere
and told me there would be a chance
that Sunday night of going to Copenhagen
on a British destroyer. Since Desmond was
a British subject we chose him to take up the
matter with the British mission. His efforts
were successful, and we left the hotel under
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>cover of darkness and, hugging the walls of
the buildings, we finally reached the British
mission. In company with several English
officers we started through the dark streets at
seven-thirty in the evening with shells falling
everywhere, and walked three miles to the
bend of the Dvina, out of range of the firing.
Twice we were shot at by Lettish outposts who
had not been informed that we were supposed
to pass. Luckily for us they proved to be bad
shots, and the shouts of “English, English”
from the officers stopped the firing. At nine
in the evening we reached the river and were
bundled into two small boats, pulled by a slow-going
gasoline launch. The Letts were on
one side of the river; the Germans on the
other, and both sides impartially fired at us
with their rifles, but although they hit each
boat once they did not touch us. I shall never
forget the English officers, crouching in the
bottoms of the boats—beside me—shouting
“English, English” at the top of their voices
as we proceeded, and persisting in their
shouting of the word that had hitherto proven
a magic one, in spite of the fact that it could
not possibly be heard by either side,
and forgetting, apparently, that if it were
heard by the Germans it might not deter
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>After two and one-half hours of this, during
which we traversed eight miles, we
reached the gulf and the comparative safety
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>of the British cruiser <cite>Abdiel</cite>. At last my
troubles were over.</p>

<p class='c000'>We were to leave for Copenhagen the next
morning. However, at ten the next morning
we were transferred from the <cite>Abdiel</cite> to the
<cite>Princess Margaret</cite>, a Canadian Royal steamer
which had been converted into a mine-layer
during the war, and had come into the harbor
the night before, on her way to Riga with a
cargo of goods. She could not proceed up the
river because of the firing. English officers
and all were transferred to this ship, because
the <cite>Abdiel</cite> was not leaving and there was no
telling when the <cite>Princess Margaret</cite> would
leave. For three days we were kept on this
boat. During this time more than a hundred
refugees from Riga were added to its
list. Eight or nine British cruisers and destroyers
were lying at anchor in the Gulf,
and on our second morning on the <cite>Princess
Margaret</cite> we learned that the English had
given the Germans until that time to evacuate
their positions, after which they would open
fire. The Germans had refused, and the
bombarding began. The <cite>Princess Margaret</cite>
stood out of range, but we could see with
glasses the effects of the bombardment, which
lasted the whole afternoon, until finally the
German guns were silenced and the Letts
crossed the river.</p>

<p class='c000'>That evening we heard that the destroyer
<cite>Cleopatra</cite> was sailing the next morning
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>for Copenhagen and England and would
come alongside to take mail, and that the
English officers on the <cite>Princess Margaret</cite>
were going on the <cite>Cleopatra</cite>. Farbman
and I sent Desmond to the captain to get
permission for us to go also, which he obtained
after some persuasion. The others
remained—and may be there still.</p>

<p class='c000'>At eight the next morning the <cite>Cleopatra</cite>
came toward us, but the sea was running high
and she could not approach nearer than a
hundred yards. A lifeboat was lowered from
the <cite>Princess</cite>, our baggage thrown in, and we
descended on rope ladders to the swaying and
tossing boat below. I am a poor swimmer
and the brief but exciting journey to the
<cite>Cleopatra</cite> was occupied in meditation on my
escape from shot and shell only to be drowned
in the waters of the Gulf.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we finally reached the <cite>Cleopatra</cite>,
I was prepared for more delay, any amount
of delay. I had grown so accustomed to it
that I thought it would save my nerves from
further strain to take it for granted. However
we started almost immediately. This
was Friday morning, October 17th. We
reached Copenhagen Saturday, October 18th,
at six in the evening. At last I had escaped
the roar of cannon and the sound of bursting
shells. The relief and the peace of Copenhagen
could only be compared with the peace
I had found in “Barbarous Soviet Russia.”</p>

<h4 class='c028'><span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>ARTICLE III <br /> METHODS OF LABOR DISTRIBUTION</h4>

<p class='c018'>15. The enforcement of the right to work shall be
secured through the Departments of Labor Distribution,
trade unions, and through all the institutions of the
Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. The assignment of wage earners to work shall
be carried out through the Departments of Labor Distribution.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. A wage earner may be summoned to work, save
by the Departments of Labor Distribution, only when
chosen for a position by a Soviet institution or enterprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. Vacancies may be filled by election when the
work offered requires political reliability or unusual special
knowledge, for which the person elected is noted.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. Persons engaged for work by election must register
in the Department of Labor Distribution before they
are accepted, but they shall not be subject to the rules
concerning probation set forth in Article IV of the
present Code.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. Unemployed persons shall be assigned to work
through the Departments of Labor Distribution in the
manner stated in Sections 21–30.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. A wage earner who is not engaged on work at
his vocation shall register in the local Department of
Labor Distribution as unemployed.</p>

<p class='c000'>22. Establishments and individuals in need of workers
should apply to the Local Department of Labor Distribution
or its division (Correspondence Bureau) stating
the condition of the work offered as well as the requirements
which the workmen must meet (trade, knowledge,
experience).</p>

<p class='c000'>23. The Department of Labor Distribution, on receipt
of the application mentioned in Section 22, shall
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>assign the persons meeting the requirements thereof in
the order determined by the same.</p>

<p class='c000'>24. An unemployed person has no right to refuse an
offer of work at his vocation, provided the working conditions
conform with the standards fixed by the respective
tariff regulations, or in the absence of the same by
the trade unions.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. A wage worker engaged for work for a period of
not more than two weeks, shall be considered unemployed,
and shall not lose his place on the list of the
Department of Labor Distribution.</p>

<p class='c000'>26. Should the Local Department of Labor Distribution
have no workers on its lists meeting the stated
requirements, the application must be immediately sent
to the District Exchange Bureau, and the establishment
or individual offering the employment shall be simultaneously
notified to this effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>27. Whenever workers are required for work outside
of their district, a roll-call of the unemployed registered
in the Department of Labor Distribution shall take place,
to ascertain who are willing to go; if a sufficient number
of such should not be found, the Department of Labor
Distribution shall assign the lacking number from among
the unemployed in the order of their registration, provided
that those who have dependents must not be given
preference, before single persons.</p>

<p class='c000'>28. If in the Departments of Labor Distribution,
within the limits of the district, there be no workmen
meeting the requirements, the District Exchange Bureau
has the right, upon agreement with the respective trade
union, to send unemployed of another class approaching
as nearly as possible the trade required.</p>

<p class='c000'>29. An unemployed person who is offered work outside
his vocation shall be obliged to accept it, on the understanding,
if he so wishes, that this be only temporary,
until he receives work at his vocation.</p>

<p class='c000'>30. A wage earner who is working outside his specialty,
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>and who has stated his wish that this be only
temporary, shall retain his place on the register on the
Department of Labor Distribution until he gets work
at his vocation.</p>

<p class='c000'>31. Private individuals violating the rules of labor
distribution set forth in this article shall be punished by
the order of the local board of the Department of
Labor Distribution by a fine of not less than 300 rubles

and officials violating these rules on labor distribution
shall be liable to criminal prosecution.</p>

<h4 class='c028'>ARTICLE IV <br /> PROBATION PERIODS</h4>

<p class='c018'>32. Final acceptance of workers for permanent employment
shall be preceded by a period of probation of
not more than six days; in Soviet institutions the probation
period shall be two weeks for unskilled and less
responsible work and one month for skilled and responsible
work.</p>

<p class='c000'>33. According to the results of the probation the
wage earner shall either be given a permanent appointment,
or rejected with payment for the period of probation
in accordance with the tariff rates.</p>

<p class='c000'>34. The results of the probation (acceptance or rejection)
shall be communicated to the Department of
Labor Distribution.</p>

<p class='c000'>35. Up to the expiration of the probation period, the
wage earner shall be considered as unemployed, and
shall retain his place on the eligible list of the Department
of Labor Distribution.</p>

<p class='c000'>36. A person who, after probation, has been rejected,
may appeal against this decision to the union of which
he is a member.</p>

<p class='c000'>37. Should the trade union consider the appeal mentioned
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>in the preceding section justified, it shall enter
into negotiations with the establishment or person who
has rejected the wage earner, with the request to accept
the complainant.</p>

<p class='c000'>38. In ease of failure of negotiations mentioned in
Section 37, the matter shall be submitted to the Local
Department of Labor, whose decision shall be final and
subject to no further appeal.</p>

and from the decision of the latter to the District Department
of Labor, whose decision shall be final and

<h3 class='c017'>THE SECOND ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF TRADES UNIONS (VOCATIONAL UNIONS)</h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED AT THE CONFERENCE</div>
    <div>Moscow, June 16th to 25th, 1919</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>A year’s work of the professional trades unions of
Russia was completed by a new conference, the second
one in its history—which shows how young our professional
movement is as yet. The past year was unparalleled
in the history of the entire international
trade union movement, both according to the kind of activity
as well as those circumstances under which our
unions had to carry on their work.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a year of the dictatorship of the proletariat.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the ruins of the demolished capitalist system, the
proletariat of Russia has taken upon itself the task
of building up a new, Socialist Russia. While struggling
and conquering, it was gradually turning to constructive
work—strengthening its dictatorship by taking
possession of the entire apparatus of the country’s
economic administration.</p>

<p class='c000'>The proletariat, organized into professional unions,
constituted the vanguard of the Socialist revolution.
The unions were the hotbeds of revolution, and it has
fallen to their lot to solve the most complicated problems—in
fact they took into their hands the management of
all economic affairs, taking over the factories, the mills
and the mines. This problem was difficult in itself,
and its complexity was increased still further through
the economic disintegration and chaos which were caused
by the imperialist world war.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Second All-Russian Conference of Trades Unions
demonstrated that the Russian professional trades union
movement has grown stronger during the year and that
its organization has improved in both quantity and quality.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>The qualitative progress made by the Russian trades
union movement expressed itself in that marvelous intelligence
which the Conference displayed in grappling
with the complicated problems it had to face. If
the first All-Russian Conference of Professional trades
unions outlined a rough draft of a plan according
to which the working class was to steer its course
during the period of its supremacy, if at that first conference
the delegates were groping in the dark, trying
to feel the correct way,—the second Conference found the
path sufficiently cleared to proceed forward toward the
solution of new problems put forth by the life and practice
of the professional movement. If at the First Conference
we could only speak of regulating industry and
controlling it, now, at this Second Conference, we can
already tabulate the results of organization in the realm
of industry by the efforts of the working class itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>A big stride forward was made by the proletariat organized
within professional trades unions, when in discussing
the question of organization it pointed out clearly
and definitely the place which the proletariat of the
entire world is occupying under the present circumstances.
The Conference has not only firmly and decisively
drawn the line between its position and that
of neutrality, but it took a definite stand in favor of
recognizing “the revolutionary class struggle for the
realization of Socialism through the dictatorship of the
proletariat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The quantitative growth of the Russian trades unions
since the first Conference, notwithstanding the fact that
the counter-revolution has snatched away a number of
provinces (Siberia, Finland, the Donetz region, Caucasia,
etc.), has resulted in a membership of 3,422,000
whereas only 2,500,000 members were represented at the
First Conference. Thus, within one year the membership
increased by almost one million. According to the
All-Russian industrial groupings, the number of union
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>members represented at the conference was distributed
as follows:</p>

75 sympathizers, 15 Left Socialists-Revolutionists,
5 Anarchists, 18 Internationalists, 4 representatives

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>From June 16th to 25th, 1919, during the nine days of
its work, the second All-Russian Congress of Trades
Unions solved the fundamental questions of the Russian
professional (trades union) movement. The Conference
more precisely defined the place of the professional
trades unions in a proletarian state, it has more concretely
outlined the interrelations of the trades unions
with the organs of administration and, above all, with
the People’s Commissariat of Labor. All other questions,
such as the regulation of working hours and wages,
the safeguarding of labor and the social insurance
of laborers, the organization of production, and workmen’s
control have been solved on the basis of the experience
of the past year.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Russian professional unions entered upon a new
era of proletarian activity. And the unions are already
facing practical problems—to put into practice
the principles and resolutions adopted and in all phases
of its work to follow one direction, that of still further
strengthening its power, and participating more closely
in establishing the might of proletarian Russia.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>THE PROBLEMS OF THE PROFESSIONAL TRADES UNIONS</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>(<em>A resolution introduced by M. Tomsky</em>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>One year of political and economic dictatorship of
the proletariat and the growth of the workers’ revolution
the world over, have fully borne out the correctness
of the position taken by the first All-Russian Conference
of the Professional Trades Unions, who have
unconditionally bound up the fate of the economically
organized proletariat with that of the Workers’ and
Peasants’ Government.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>The attempt, under the flag of “unity” and “independence”
of the trades union movement, to pit the
economically organized proletariat against the organs
of the political dictatorship of its own class, has led
the groups which were supporting this slogan, to an
open struggle against the Soviet Government and has
placed them outside the ranks of the working class.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the course of the practical cooperation with the
Soviet Government in the work for the strengthening
and organization of the nation’s economic life, the professional
trades unions have passed from control over
industry to organization of industry, taking an active
part in the management of individual enterprises as well
as in the entire economic life of the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the task of nationalization of all the means of
production and the organization of society on the new
principles of Socialism demands persistent and careful
labor involving the reconstruction of the entire governmental
apparatus, the creation of new organs of control,
and regulation of production and distribution,
based on the organization and activity of the laboring
masses who are themselves directly interested in the
results.</p>

<p class='c000'>This makes it imperative for the trades unions to
take a more active and energetic part in the work of
the Soviet Government (through direct participation
in all governmental institutions, through the organization
of proletarian mass control over their actions, and
the carrying out, by means of their organization, of
individual problems with which the Soviet Government
is confronted), to aid in the reconstruction of various
governmental institutions and in the gradual replacement
of the same by their own organizations by amalgamating
the unions with the governmental institutions.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, it would be a mistake at the given stage of
development of the professional trades union movement
with the insufficiently developed organization to convert
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>immediately the unions into governmental organs and
to amalgamate the two organizations as well as for the
unions to usurp of their own accord the functions of
governmental institutions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The entire process of complete amalgamation of the
professional unions with the organs of government administration
must come as an absolutely inevitable result
of their work, in complete and close cooperation and harmony
and the preparation of the laboring masses, for
the task of managing the governmental apparatus and
all the institutions for the regulation of the country’s
economic life.</p>

<p class='c000'>This, in its turn, places before the unions the problem
of welding together the as yet unorganized proletarian
and semi-proletarian masses into strong productive unions,
initiating them, under the control of the proletarian
unions, into the task of social reconstruction and
the general work of strengthening their organizations,
as regards centralization and smoothly working unions
as well as the strengthening of professional discipline.</p>

<p class='c000'>Directly participating in all fields of Soviet work,
forming and supplying the man-power for the governmental
institutions, the professional unions must,
through this work for which they must enlist their own
organizations as well as the laboring masses, educate
and prepare them for the task of managing not only
production but the entire apparatus of government.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>PROFESSIONAL UNIONS AND THE COMMISSARIAT</h3>
</div>
<p class='c018'>OF LABOR</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>(<em>A resolution embodied in V. Schmidt’s report</em>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Professional trades unions organized according to the
scale of production, called upon to regulate the conditions
of labor and production in the interests of the
working class as a whole, under the conditions of proletarian
dictatorship, are becoming gradually converted
into economic associations of the proletariat, acquiring
a nation-wide significance. On the other hand, the
Commissariat of Labor, as an organ of the Workers’ and
Peasants’ Government, in which the organized industrial
proletariat is at the present moment playing a leading
part, serves as an instrument for the introduction of
the economic policy of the working class, utilizing for
this purpose its apparatus and all the power vested in
governmental authorities to enforce its laws and regulations.</p>

<p class='c000'>Therefore, with a view to eliminating the duality in
the united economic policy of the working class, it is
necessary to recognize that all fundamental decisions
of the supreme union organ—the Congress of Professional
Unions—are to be adopted by the People’s Commissariat
of Labor and embodied in its proposed legislation
and all special obligatory regulations bearing on
the conditions of labor and production, must first be
approved by a majority of the All-Russian Central Council
of Professional Trades Unions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Conference fully approves of coordination and
cooperation between the All-Russian Central Council of
Trades Unions and the People’s Commissariat of Labor
and suggests that the local councils (Soviets) of trades
unions participate in the work of local branches (departments)
of the Commissariat of Labor, on the basis
of the relations prevailing between the central bodies,
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>for which purpose the local councils of trades unions
are to send their representatives into the leading Soviets
and make up out of the union apparatus its subdivisions
(tariff, social insurance, labor safeguarding, etc.)</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to finally eliminate all duplication in the
solution of questions concerning the conditions and
regulation of labor by separate departments, the Conference
suggests that the All-Russian Central Executive
Committee and the Soviet of People’s Commissaries
concentrate all its efforts to the working out of standards
regulating the conditions of work, wages, organization
of labor, order of employing and discharging
help, safeguarding labor, and social insurance, through
the People’s Commissariat of Labor.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>THE PARTICIPATION OF THE UNIONS IN THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>(<em>A resolution on the report made by Comrade Rudzutak</em>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>1. The process of taking over the control of the
industries which is now being completed by the workers’
government, places the vocational associations in
a position where they are coming to play an ever more
and more important part in the special fields of their
activity.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Standing in close relationship to the actual production
and thus being the natural guardians of industry
against the remnants of the bureaucratic apparatus permeated
by the traditions of the old regime, the unions
must build a new Socialist order, in accordance with the
fixed program of production based on a national plan for
the utilization of the proper products and material.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>3. In the interests of preserving a single plan of
organization of production, management and distribution,
it will be necessary to concentrate in one center
all the units of production, which are now in the charge
of various departments (Chief Artillery Department,
Navy and War Departments, etc.)</p>

<p class='c000'>4. The participation of the unions in the industrial
management should consist in the working out of a
system of activity for the regulating and managing organs
as a whole, insofar as there is a possibility of some
part or other of their membership not being permeated
by the spirit of Socialistic constructive activity. The
management of the leading departments and centers
must be composed mainly of the representatives of professional
unions, following an understanding between
the corresponding All-Russian Industrial Association or
the All-Russian Council of Trades Unions and the presiding
officers of the Supreme Council of National Economy.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. All delegates representing the trades unions within
the administrative and regulating bodies are responsible
to the corresponding unions and are to report on
their activities at regular intervals.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. In order to keep up the organic connection between
the unions and the management of the government
owned mills, the unions are to call conferences of the
management of the largest enterprises, not less than
once in two months, for the purpose of discussing and
passing upon the most important practical questions
arising in the process of work.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. In order to convert the regulating and managing
organs into a proletarian apparatus for constructive
Socialist work and in order to obtain the cooperation
in this work of the large masses of the more advanced
workers, it is necessary to saturate all the organs of regulation
and management with proletarian elements by
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>means of placing in their ranks responsible workers
who assert themselves within the central and local trade
union groups.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. Together with the part which the unions are playing
in the matter of directing the industrial life along
the channels fixed by the programs of production, based
upon the subjugation of private interest to those of society
as a whole, comes their activity in connection with
the basic element of production—labor. Therefore, the
decisions of the central trade union associations are obligatory
insofar as they bear on the questions of wage
scales, inspection of labor, internal regulations within
the factories, standards of production and labor discipline.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. Being placed in the position of organizers of production
at a moment when Russia is now more than at
any other time, affected by a shortage of various kinds
of material which causes a reduction of the output, the
unions must safeguard the proletariat against the possibility
of its exhaustion or degeneration, as a class of
producers, at this critical period, and to safeguard its
nucleus against social disintegration and its absorption
by other classes; it is therefore necessary:</p>

<p class='c029'>(<em>a</em>) wherever a shortage of raw material exists
to reduce the working day or the number of days
per week, keeping employed at the factory the largest
possible number of workers.</p>

<p class='c029'>(<em>b</em>) to introduce, wherever the number of hours
or days per week is reduced, obligatory attendance
at technical and educational courses, so as to utilize
the crisis for the purpose of lifting the technical
and cultural level of the laboring masses.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. At the same time, in view of the primary significance
of actually supplying the mills with the necessary
products, and the impossibility of increasing the productivity
of labor and introducing discipline, unless this
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>question is solved in a satisfactory manner, it is necessary
to enable the trades unions to participate as closely
as possible in the work of production and distribution
of provisions.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>WORKERS’ CONTROL</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>(<em>Resolution in connection with N. Glebov’s report</em>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The Second All-Russian Congress of Vocational Unions,
having heard the report on workers’ control, recognizes
the following:</p>

<p class='c000'>1. Workers’ control, which was the strongest revolutionary
weapon in the hands of the labor organizations
in their struggle against economic disruption and the
sabotage practised by the employers in their struggle
against the proletariat for economic supremacy, has led
the working class into direct participation in the organization
of production.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. The economic dictatorship of the working class
has created new conditions which stirred up the activity
of the large masses of the workers. Through their vocational
associations the workers have been called upon
to organize the country’s economic life and to participate
in the management of production.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. At the same time the working class domination
over the economic life of the country has not as yet
been completed. A subdued struggle is still seething
within the new forms of economic life, which calls forth
the necessity on the part of the laboring masses to control
the activities of the institutions in charge of the
management of production.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. Under such conditions of transition from the capitalist
system to the Socialist regime, the workers’ control
must develop, from a revolutionary weapon for the
economic dictatorship of the proletariat, into a practical
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>institution aiding in the strengthening of this dictatorship
in the process of production.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. The problems of workers’ control must be confined
to the supervision of the course of work in the various
establishments, and to practically check on the activity
of the management of individual mills as well as that
of entire branches of industry. The workers’ control
is carried out in practice in a certain order according
to which control does not precede, but, on the contrary,
follows the executive work.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. Workers’ control is also to solve the problem of
the gradual preparation of the large masses of the working
class for direct participation in the matter of management
and organization of industry.</p>

<p class='c000'>With this object in view the Congress resolves:</p>

<p class='c000'>1. To confirm the decision of the first All-Russian
Congress of Vocational Unions regarding the formation
of organs of control, both local and central, under
the guidance of the vocational associations of the working
class.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Within every nationalized industrial, commercial,
and transport house, the local committee for control
takes upon itself the supervision of the work of the
enterprise and the activities of its management, for
which purpose it gathers and systematizes all data relative
to the running of the establishment and places the
same at the disposal of the control department of their
trade union, before which, whenever the necessity arises,
the question of auditing the books of the enterprise is
brought up.</p>

<p class='c029'><em>Note.</em> In extraordinary cases the local control
commission has the right on its own responsibility
to fix the time for a revision of their enterprise,
with a precise statement of the subject of control,
on condition that the local control committee immediately
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>notify to that effect the Department of Control
of the corresponding industrial (vocational)
union.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. The local control committee is being formed of:
(<em>a</em>) representatives of the corresponding industrial (vocational)
union; (<em>b</em>) of the persons elected by the general
meeting of the workers employed in a given factory,
who are subject to approval by the committee of
the corresponding industrial (vocational) union. The
members of the local control committee elected from
among the committee of the industrial union, retain
their office for a considerable length of time; while the
persons elected at the general meeting are to be replaced
in as short a period as possible, with a view to training
the large masses of the people in the work of management
and organization of industry so as to insure the
gradual transition to the system of universal participation
in it of all the workers.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. The local control committee is responsible for its
activities both before the general meeting of the workers
of their factory and before the control department of
their industrial (vocational) union. In case of abuse of
authority, negligence in carrying out its duties, and so
on, the local control committee is subject to severe punishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. The representatives of the local control committee
participate at the sessions of the management of the
mill or factory, having only a voice, but no vote in
the matter. The rights of administration of the establishment
remains with the management and therefore
the entire responsibility for the work of the enterprise
rests with the management.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. The coordination of the workers’ control within the
limits of any given industry must be centered within
the industrial (vocational) union. The union creates
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>a Workers’ Control Department which is responsible before
the management of its union.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. The Congress authorizes the All-Russian Central
Council (Soviet) of Vocational Unions to direct the institutions
of workers’ control. For this purpose the All-Russian
Central Council is to form a supreme organ
of workers’ control, composed of the representatives of
the industrial (vocational) unions.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. With a view to coordinating all activities and
eliminating the duplication of functions in the work
of control, the organs of the People’s Commissariat of
State Control must work in contact with the controlling
organs of the industrial (vocational) unions.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. The supreme organ of workers’ control is to work
out the instructions, fully determining the rights and
duties of the lower organs of control and their organization.
Until such time as these instructions are made
public the organs of workers’ control in the nationalized
enterprises are to be guided by these rulings.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. The regulations for the workers’ control of nationalized
enterprises must be decreed by the Council
of People’s Commissaries.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. In the establishments which have not been nationalized
workers’ control is to be carried out in accordance
with the decree of November 14, 1917.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>WAGE AND WORK REGULATION</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>(<em>Resolution introduced in connection with V. Schmidt’s report</em>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Observing a great variety and lack of coordination
of the tariff (wage scale) regulations which hamper
not only the standardization of labor, but their practical
materialization, and explaining such an abnormal
phenomenon in this matter by the presence of a number
of glaring defects, (absence of a definite system
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>of wages, which would serve as a basis of the tariff regulations,
the elasticity of groups and categories, the elimination
from these regulations of the salaries of the
higher technical, commercial and administrative personnel),
defects due to the rapid transition from one form
of wage scale regulation to another; due to the weakness
of the local unions and their local separatism, and, finally,
the inconsistency (instability) of the local organs
of governments in regard to the wage regulation policy,
the Second All-Russian Congress of Vocational Unions
deems it necessary to introduce the following amendments
and additions to the wage regulations:</p>

<p class='c000'>1. The basic principle of wage scale regulation, in
connection with the struggle for the restoration of the
country’s economic forces, must be the responsibility
of the laborers and other employees for the productivity
of labor before their union, and the responsibility of the
latter before the class associations of the proletariat.
For this purpose the wage scale regulations must be
based on the system of compensation of labor power
which would serve as an incentive for the laborers to
outdo each other in their desire to raise the productivity
of labor in the nationalized enterprises, i.e. the piece-work
and premium system founded on a rock-bottom
standard of production, with a firmly fixed schedule of
either increased pay or decreased hours of work in
compensation for production above the standard requirements.</p>

<p class='c000'>In those branches of industry where it is impossible
to standardize the work, a scale of wages is to be applied
on the basis of the time employed with definite hours
of work and strict working regulations.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. The wage scale of the industrial union is to include
the higher technical, commercial and administrative
personnel, whose salaries are to be subject to the
control of the union. In accordance with this, the tariff
regulation is to be divided into three fundamental parts;
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>(<em>a</em>) the higher technical, commercial, and administrative
personnel; (<em>b</em>) the lower technical and administrative
personnel; the employees of the managements, the offices,
institutions and commercial establishments, and
(<em>c</em>) the laborers.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. In order to eliminate too large a number of
groups and categories (five groups and 15 categories)
and to insure a fair compensation of the basic
nucleus of the workers and other employees occupied
in the industries, a subdivision into four groups
and 12 categories is fixed for each of the three ranks
(the higher personnel, the lower staff, the workers),
the ratio of the higher wage to the lower within the
limits of each one of the four given groups, from the
first category to the 12th, is 1:1.75.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. The wage scale regulations for individual groups
of the workers and for certain branches of industry or
parts thereof, must contain provisions either for the
shortening of hours, or for the increase of pay as compensation
for particularly harmful, dangerous, difficult
or exhaustive labor, and in connection with climatic conditions.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. Clothing and footwear is to be distributed to the
workers engaged in the wood chopping industry, the
sewerage and street cleaning industry, or occupied in
underground work, work at a particularly high temperature,
or necessitating the handling of harmful chemicals.
Particularly difficult and harmful work (such as, underground
work, the peat gathering industry, the preparation
of wood fuel, work at a high temperature, work
with poisonous gases and acids exhausting the system)
should carry with it a home and a higher wage. This
latter measure is to be carried out by the All-Russian
and local councils of the Vocational Unions. In order
to put these additions and amendments to the wage scale
regulations into actual life and in order to do away with
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>the obnoxious multiformity the Congress resolves:</p>

<p class='c000'>To recognize the wage scale regulation which is being
carried out on a national scale and which affects all
the workers and employees of a given industry, from
the highest administrator down to the skilled laborer,—as
the one which best answers the fundamental needs of
standardizing the wages.</p>

<p class='c000'>To grant to the All-Russian Central Committee of
the Industrial Unions the exclusive right to finally work
out the wage scale regulations and to submit them for
approval of the All-Russian Central Council of Professional
Unions and to the People’s Commissariat of
Labor.</p>

<p class='c000'>To deprive the local branches of the All-Russian centralized
unions of the right to directly submit their
wage scale for approval over the head of their central
body, so long as an All-Russian industrial wage scale
is in operation.</p>

<p class='c000'>To leave to the local Soviets (councils) of the Vocational
Unions the right to fix the wage scale regulations
only for the local unions, which have no All-Russian association,
using the wage scale regulations in force as
a guide; under no circumstances changing the regulations
passed on a national scale. Besides, it is the duty
of the local Soviets of the Vocational Unions to coordinate
individual scales in different industries while putting
them into practice, and the right to present a
grounded petition for the transfer of a given locality
into another district in accordance with the proportional
(percentage) scale of district decrease of wages.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Congress approves of the work of the committee
and the section on the construction of wage scale regulations
and recommends to the All-Russian centralized industrial
unions to accept them as a basis. The Congress
authorizes the All-Russian Central Council of Vocational
Unions to carry out this resolution strictly and without
any deviations.</p>

which were enacted for the safeguarding of labor
and the individual kinds of social insurance of the
workers were being enforced under the control of the
capitalist state, together with the employing class, and
beyond the reach of direct influence of the labor organizations.
With the establishment of the dictatorship of
the proletariat it became possible for the first time to
put point blank all the questions arising out of the
struggle against the grave consequences of the conditions
of labor, which remain as a legacy of the capitalist
era, as well as preventive measures and the solutions of
the questions, in accordance with the Socialist aims of the
present moment. The actual safeguarding of labor and
the social insurance of the worker, with a view to safeguarding
his life and increasing his strength and power,
proved to be indissoluble aspects of the same problem—changing
of conditions of labor, the reconstruction of
the industrial environment in which the worker is laboring,
and the betterment of his living conditions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The October revolution determined the basic principles
of social defence for the proletariat of Russia, having
given over the safeguarding of labor and social insurance
of the toilers into the hands of the working class, and
for the first time it has created organs of factory inspection
on the basis of elective representation.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the acute civil war and the economic work of
organization, as the fundamental problem which has
been confronting the working class during the first year
of the October <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’état</span></em>, have diverted the attention
<span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>of the proletariat from a problem of no lesser significance—the
safeguarding of its health, as the main source
of national economy—and its economic organizations
became indifferent. This is the reason why the working
class paid but very little attention to questions of labor
safeguards and social insurance, as well as to the institutions
in charge of these questions.</p>

<hr class='c032' />

<p class='c000'>At the present moment, however, the building of a
new life, the reconstruction of the conditions of labor
on a Socialist foundation, the safeguarding of production
for the life and health of the workers, the betterment
of their living conditions, the workers’ insurance against
all accidents depriving him of his labor power, the amalgamation
of the various kinds of insurance agencies
into one powerful organization, and the management of
the same, are becoming the most important problems
which the vocational unions are to solve. Together with
the economic work of organization which includes the
safeguarding of labor, social insurance of the toilers
must take the proper place in the every-day work of the
unions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Taking all this into consideration, the second Congress
of Vocational Unions finds it necessary that the vocational
unions—</p>

<p class='c000'>1. Take active part in the construction of united government
insurance bodies through the formation of corresponding
subdivisions within the departments of labor
of the local Soviets, in accordance with the instructions
of the Department of Social Insurance and Labor
Safeguards of the People’s Commissariat of Labor; 2.
That they energetically carry out the “regulations of
social insurance of the workers” of October 31st, 1918;
3. That they immediately start the organization within
the unions of permanent committees on the safeguarding
of labor, and of <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nuclei</span></em> for the same within the various
mills and factories for the purpose of cooperating with
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>the governmental institutions charged with the safeguarding
of labor; 4. That they intensify the work on
the spot for the creation of labor inspection by means
of selection and training for this purpose of the active
workers; 5. That they practically spread the validity of
the safeguarding of labor regulations and their enforcement
over all types of labor (in the building trades, in
the transport service, over domestic servants, commercial
and office workers, restaurant help, and agricultural
workers); 6. That they pay particular attention to
the conditions of labor in the small semi-handicraft establishments;
7. That they assist in the practical efforts
of labor inspection to remove the children from
the works and for the introduction of a shorter work-day
for minors, enabling them at the same time to continue
their education; 8. That they take an active part in the
organization of local sanitary-hygienic and technical investigations
of the conditions at the factories and mills,
and in the working out of various obligatory standards
and various measures for the safeguarding of labor; 9.
That they carry out the principles of labor safeguarding
through the current activity of the local and central
organs regulating the nation’s economy; 10. That they
take an active part in the work of improving the living
conditions of the working population; 11. That they
energetically push the agitational and educational work
among the proletarian masses along the lines of vocational
hygiene and sanitation and the technique of insuring
safety, as well as on general questions of social
insurance and labor safeguarding.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>THE INTERRELATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL INSURANCE<br /> AND LABOR SAFEGUARDS OF THE PEOPLE’S COMMISSARIAT OF LABOR <br /> AND THE PEOPLE’S COMMISSARIAT OF SOCIAL INSURANCE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Whereas in the process of development of the social
revolution the division of society into a handful of
parasites, on the one hand, and into the masses of workers
and peasants overloaded with excessive toil, on the
other, is constantly disappearing, and the entire population
is being transformed into a mass of producers who
must be insured, in accordance with the provisions of
the regulations on social insurance of the laborers, of
October 31, 1918, against all accidents that might incapacitate
them, and</p>

<p class='c000'>Whereas the work of social insurance can be developed
on condition of immediate participation of vocational
unions through the medium of the corresponding
organs of the People’s Commissariat of Labor,</p>

<p class='c000'>The second Congress of Vocational Unions holds that
all insurance business, its functions, the institutions of
the People’s Commissariat of Social Insurance, affecting
the workers, must be amalgamated into the common
work of the Department of Social Insurance and Labor
Safeguard of the People’s Commissariat of Labor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having discussed the question of interrelations between
the Commissariat of Public Health and the Department
of Social Insurance and Labor Safeguards
of the People’s Commissariat of Labor, the second All-Russian
Congress of Vocational Unions resolved to accept
the following principles as a basis for the solution
of the question:</p>

<p class='c000'>1. Social insurance and labor safeguarding being a
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>complete and logically united institution, with the dictatorship
of the proletariat in power, when the entire
population of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic
is being transformed into laborers, covers the
activities of Commissariat of Health, thus representing
under the circumstances one of the most important and
most necessary links of one chain.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. It is possible to carry into life the measures of
social insurance and labor safeguards with the necessary
system and on a vast scale, only if the work is
done in the closest connection and intimate touch with
the masses that are interested in it, and on the condition
that the masses cooperate most energetically.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. The union of any group of functions into one
whole may be determined exclusively by their proximity
and similarity, else there is a possibility of the least efficient
combination of all or any individual branches
of government activity, to the detriment of the regular
development and direction of the same and to the certain
amount of independence so necessary to each and
every one of the activities.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. The medico-prophylactic activity, like the entire
institution for social insurance and labor safeguards,
must be united, i.e., both the organizing and organic
work is concentrated in the hands of bodies and institutions
specially created for that purpose, and depending
from the same common central body. As regards the
necessary differentiation of labor it must be carried out
exclusively within the common bodies, but under no circumstances
must it be done by means of tearing away
from them of any of the parts closely bound through
common problems and peculiarities of the work, no
matter how considerable each of them, taken apart,
might be.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>In view of the above principles, the Congress resolves
that:</p>

<p class='c000'>1. The Commissariat of Public Health must be amalgamated
with the Department of Social Insurance and
Labor Safeguards.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. All organs of social insurance and labor safeguards
must be built from top to bottom entirely on
the basis of vocational unions’ representation.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. The question of the order of uniting the Commissariat
of Public Health with the Department of Social
Insurance and Labor Safeguards of the People’s Commissariat
of Labor is given over to the Central Executive
Committee for consideration.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE VOCATIONAL UNIONS <br /> AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>(<em>Resolution based on Tzyperovich’s and Kossior’s reports</em>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>1. The Socialist revolution has put before the proletariat
a series of the most important problems in the
field of reconstruction. Simultaneously and in connection
with the revolutionization of the economic relations,
the working class, as the standard-bearer of Socialism,
must get down to the work of creating a proletarian
culture, instead of that of the bourgeoisie, in order to
prepare the masses for the complete realization of the
Socialist Commonwealth.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. The dictatorship of the proletariat, enabling the
working class to fully utilize all the cultural acquisitions
of mankind, is already now putting forward a new creative
form of the cultural movement, in the shape of
proletarian cultural organizations.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>3. Vocational unions, as working class organizations,
notwithstanding all their weakness and the isolation
of the proletarian cultural organizations from the
masses of the working class must organically enter into
their work, concentrating within them all their activity
for the general work along questions of science and art
and endeavoring with a view to making it sound, to
subject their activity to the influence and guidance of
the industrially organized laboring masses.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. The Vocational Unions are also facing as an immediate
problem the utilization on as large a scale as
possible of those facilities which have been created by
the Commissariat of Public Education in the matter of
compulsory, and free education, of education for people
above school age, for technical training, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vocational unions must have their representatives
in the Commissariats of Public Education, who are to
shed light on the needs of the trade union movement
and demand that these needs be satisfied immediately.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. At the same time, the vocational unions are to
continue their cultural and educational activity, creating
educational institutions and organizations which would
answer the immediate problems of the vocational movement.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. The building up of clubs, especially for the districts
and provinces, is desirable. The type of a vocational-political
club is preferable, if possible of a large
size.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. It is necessary at present to build libraries in
the districts. But for the central trade-industrial unions
special libraries are to a certain extent superfluous
(outside of special publications, guides, etc.) They
can easily and with much greater success be replaced
by public and municipal libraries, to which the trade-industrial
unions should turn their attention, by sending
to the same the representatives of their cultural-educational
departments, as delegates.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>8. The publishing associations of the individual
unions must be technically united into one Publishing
Association of the Council of Unions. The program of
the publications must be adapted to the needs of the
trade union movement, but at the same time it must
be so flexible and elastic as to be of service to the agitational
activity of the unions in various directions (appeals,
bulletins, etc.). The amalgamation of the periodic
trade-union organs,—is a problem of the immediate
future. Besides, it is necessary to issue at present a
monthly or semi-monthly magazine in order to explain
the general questions of theory and practice of the trade-industrial
movement.</p>

<p class='c000'>The organization of central expeditions for all trade
union publishing societies is already now an imperative
necessity.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. In order to materialize the above enumerated
problems each central body of the trade-industrial
unions of a given industry is to have its own cultural
and educational department whose activities are to be
coordinated by the Soviets (councils) of the Vocational
Unions at the center and in the local branches.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the question of vocational training the Congress
finds that:</p>

<p class='c000'>1. Vocational training, as one of the mightiest weapons
in the general system of cultural-industrial socialist
education of the working class, may attain its object on
condition that, together with the vocational training of
the workers along the lines of skilled labor, they will
also be given a general industrial education, acquainting
them with the general questions of the condition of
technical and industrial development, political economy,
economic geography, and also the questions of administrative
and technical management of an enterprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. Vocational training is concentrated in the hands
of the Committee on Vocational Training, which is
formed at the Commissariat of Public Education of
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>the representatives of the vocational unions. The Committee
is given charge of the general direction, financing
and working out of a single program in the field of vocational
training. For the management of each individual
school a School Soviet is formed of the representatives
of the vocational union, the Commissariat, and
the students.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. Within each branch of industry, a network of
vocational schools is to be established as soon as the
needs and requirements of the corresponding All-Russian
Vocational Association are made known. In the
first place the schools are being organized in those places
and points for the preparation of such groups and types,
of skilled workers as will be found necessary by the
proper industrial associations.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. The cultural and educational departments of the
All-Russian Industrial Associations are connected with
the Committee on Vocational Training of the Commissariat
of Education and are to determine both the quantity
and type of school needed and the technical possibility
of their opening in this or that particular locality.
The Committee is bound immediately to satisfy these
demands, in case of necessity taking a census of the
technical personnel available as instructors in vocational
schools.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. The vocational unions will utilize the schools for
the organization of courses and lectures on questions of
theory and practice of the labor movement, striving at
their widest possible development and their transformation
into a disseminator of all kinds of cultural and
technical knowledge among the proletarian masses.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>THE QUESTION OF PROVISIONING</h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>(<em>A resolution based on Comrade Antzelovich’s report</em>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Fully supporting the general principal policy of the
Workers’ and Peasants’ Government on the questions
of provisioning and supplying the population, taking into
consideration the extraordinary difficulty of the food
situation, caused by the general conditions of the moment
and by the weakness of the food supplying apparatus,
the Congress resolves to give its best forces to the
work of organization of the provisioning work, to continue
the work of mobilization and centralization for
this purpose of the proletarian forces on an all-Russian
scale, and is hereby submitting for the approval of the
Council of People’s Commissaries the provisions stated
below:</p>

<p class='c000'>1. The Congress recognizes the War-Provisioning
Bureau of the All-Russian Soviet of Vocational Unions,
acting in accordance with the instructions adopted by
the Soviet, as the central body in charge of mobilization
and distribution of the proletarian forces in the
field of provisioning.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to fulfil its tasks the War-Provisioning Bureau
of the All-Russian Soviet of Vocational Unions:
(<em>a</em>) mobilizes the labor power, selecting it from among
the vocational unions and their organs (the shop committees,
etc.); (<em>b</em>) promotes the workers into the positions
of members of the colleges, provincial provisioning
committees, district provisioning committees, and
other provisioning organizations, appointing them to
office through the People’s Commissariat for provisioning;
(<em>c</em>) sends the workers’ provisioning detachments
composed of the best forces into the villages to do the
work of organization. The detachments are working
under the leadership of members delegated by the War-Provisioning
Bureau into the local provisioning bodies,
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>and are to act as auxiliary organizations to those provisioning
bodies; (<em>d</em>) it organizes the provisional expeditions
with special tasks to aid the provisioning organizations
among them in the localities freed from
occupation; (<em>e</em>) it organizes the work of labor inspection,
working under the control of the War-Provisioning
Bureau, both in the field of provisioning and in the allied
fields of transportation, etc.; the problems of inspection
consist of the renovation, reorganization and
the placing of the entire system of provisioning bodies
on a proletarian basis; (<em>f</em>) it selects with the aid of the
proper vocational unions specialists in different lines
of the provisioning work, making them available to fill
executive offices; (<em>g</em>) in its work the Central War-Provisioning
Bureau is leaning for support on the auxiliary
local war-provisioning bureaus of the Soviets of Vocational
Unions, uniting the entire activity of the vocational
unions for the betterment of the provisioning work.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. From the point of view of unity of the general
system of distribution of necessaries, the Congress deems
it necessary to put into practice in full measure the participation
of labor cooperation in the matter of distributing
the products so that, in the course of time, and
labor, all the united system of distribution may be organized
after the pattern of a single type of consumers’
communes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Workers’ cooperative societies must become the chief
distributors of products among the workers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Considering it necessary thus to impose on the workers’
cooperative societies the extremely important task
of constructive Socialist work and the work of actually
supplying the workers with the necessaries, without
which the productivity of labor cannot be increased, the
Congress holds that these functions can best be carried
out by the workers’ cooperatives on the following conditions:
(<em>a</em>) the creation of a united organized basis
for the cooperative and vocational associations (factory
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>or mill committees), which is to be carried into practice
by means of an agreement between the All-Russian
Council of Vocational Unions and the All-Russian Council
of Workers’ Cooperative Societies; (<em>b</em>) the All-Russian
Councils of Vocational Unions and the Workers’
Cooperative Societies exchange representatives; (<em>c</em>) all
members of the vocational unions must join the Workers’
Cooperative Society and every member of the latter
must become a member of a vocational union; (<em>d</em>) the
common leading body of the workers’ cooperative societies
must be the meeting of representatives (conferences)
of the shop committees and collective associations, uniting
the employees and the laborers not occupied in the
mills and factories; (<em>e</em>) the workers’ cooperatives must
immediately be induced to participate in the broadest
possible manner in the work of organizing all municipal
commerce; the control and general direction in the
matter remaining in the hands of the provisioning bodies;
(<em>f</em>) the existing special productive-distributive organs
such as that in charge of transportation of the provisions,
waterway transportation of provisions, (canals,
rivers, etc.), must be transformed into well organized,
open workers’ cooperative societies; (<em>g</em>) the workers’
cooperative societies are to be induced to take up the
practical work of organization of these branches of industry
whose scale and problems justify such work, and
which are engaged in the production of the prime necessities.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. The furnishing of the proletariat with the products
provided for it by the government plans of distribution,
must be insured through the appropriation of a
special fund for the purpose on the plan adopted for
the army. The special department of the Commissariat
for Provisioning which is in charge of the planning,
calculating, and distributing of the products intended
for the workers, must be organized in accordance with
an understanding between the All-Russian Council of
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>Vocational Unions and the Council of Workers’ Cooperatives,
and it must not form its own technical and economic
apparatus.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. In order to help the methods of proletarian work
to permeate more fully the entire system of the provisioning
institutions it is necessary to inject into their
midst representatives of Vocational Unions and Workers’
Cooperative Societies, particularly representatives
of the All-Russian Council of Vocational Unions and
the All-Russian Council of Cooperative Societies, into
the Collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Provisioning.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the matter of preparing the products which are
subject to monopoly, by government counter-agents (as
per decree of January 21st) the central workers’ cooperatives
(city) and all centralized workers’ cooperative
organizations (regional, provincial and all-Russian)
are to be called upon to help, while the matter of preparing
the products not subject to monopoly should be
entirely given over to the cooperative societies, headed
by the Workers’ Cooperative Society, the management
to be given over to the Central Buying Committee (Tzentrozakup)
and a corresponding portion of the products
is to be set aside for the needs of the army.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. In order to create a solid basis in the matter of
supplying farm products and with a view to intensifying
agriculture and other types of farming it is necessary
to call upon the workers’ cooperative societies to
properly utilize and organize the large Soviet agricultural
establishments and other farming undertakings.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. For the successful solution of its tasks in the domain
of Socialist construction work it is necessary to
bring about the closest organizational union and coordination
of activity of the vocational unions and workers’
cooperative societies in the matter of raising the class
consciousness of that proletariat and, for this purpose,
the joint organization of workers’ homes, clubs, institutes
for practitioners, and so on.</p>

  <span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>
<h3 class='c017'>THE QUESTION OF ORGANIZATION</h3>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>(<em>Resolution based an M. Tomsky’s report</em>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<h4 class='c028'>1. <br /> GENERAL PRINCIPLES</h4>

<p class='c018'>1. Adapting its organizations to the conditions of
the economic struggle in capitalist society, the working
class in the interests of economy and concentration of
its divided forces, gradually passed over from the close
narrow guild organizations to the broader vocational
and, finally, in the course of struggle against capitalism,
building its forces on the principle of more efficient centralization
of power for the realization of its war aims
(class war aims), it came to form organizations embracing
all the workers of a given branch of industry (production)
into one union.</p>

<p class='c000'>The industrial union is one union having the follow-lowing
basic characteristics: (<em>a</em>) the union rallies all
the workers and other employees engaged in a given
branch of production, regardless of his functions; (<em>b</em>)
the treasury is centralized; (<em>c</em>) the business of the union
is transacted on the basis of democratic centralization;
(<em>d</em>) the wage scales and conditions of labor are determined
by one central body for all the categories of labor;
(<em>e</em>) a uniform principle of construction from top to
bottom; (<em>f</em>) the sections are playing the part of technical
and auxiliary organs; (<em>g</em>) the interests of the industrially
organized workers and other employees of a
given industry are represented before the outside world
by one central body.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. The industrial union comprises only the permanent
workers and employees of a given industry who
are directly engaged in the process of production or
serve to aid the same. All auxiliary branches serving
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span><em>not production but the producers</em> and all the temporary
and casual help remain members of their industrial
union.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. This principle of construction of our unions recognized
by the third Conference of the Vocational
Unions, and by the first All-Russian Congress of Vocational
Unions, presupposing the union of all the workers
of a given industry into one organization (union), can be
consistently carried into practice only by means of uniting
all the workers and employees (“higher” and “lower”)
into one union, which became possible of realization
only after the political and economic prejudices
separating the laborer from the other employees and
from the technical personnel have been done away with.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. Even if the first Congress of Vocational Unions
considered it impracticable to unite into one union all
the higher employees and laborers,—at the present moment,
after a year of proletarian dictatorship during
which a good deal of the antagonism between the different
categories of laborers and other employees has
been spent, when it has been proved from experience
that one union in its turn leads to the eradication of all
antagonism in the midst of the workers—it must now be
recognized as desirable and necessary to unite into one
union all persons who are wage workers engaged in one
establishment, one industry or one institution.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only in such establishments or institutions where
the hiring of laborers and other employees and the increase
or decrease of their wages is being decided by
one member of the administrative or technical personnel,
the latter cannot be members of the given union.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. The industrial principle of union structure as applied
to workers occupied in other branches of national
industries, than manufacture (transportation, commerce,
and farming), and also in institutions fulfilling definite
functions of government (postal-telegraph, medico-sanitary
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>departments, education, etc.), must be used to
unite the workers of small isolated branches of industry
and management into more powerful unions. As a basis
for such amalgamation one must take the similarity of
conditions of labor and the functions carried out.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. Categorically defending the consistent introduction
and application of the principle underlying production
as regards all categories of workers, not accepting
into its labor organizations those unions which are
built on guild, corporation and narrow trade lines, for
the purpose of better serving the economic interests of
the most typical industrial groups and categories, the
organization of sections on a local and national scale
is allowed within each vocational union.</p>

<p class='c000'>The unions binding together several allied branches
of industry have the right to form industrial sections,
the same having the right to call independent Congresses
in order to decide the questions of their own industry,
on condition however, that the decisions of such sectional
Congresses, which will be contrary to the rulings
of the general Congress or the regulations of the leading
organs of the labor union movement, may be annulled
by the leading body of the industrial union.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. Striving towards unity and smooth work in labor
union activity and the greatest efficiency in the utilization
of the power and means at the disposal of the labor
unions, it is necessary to recognize most definitely the
principle of centralization of the union organization,
based on unity and centralization of union finances and
strict inter- and intra-union discipline.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. With this principle as a starting-point, the <em>organization
of the section cannot have the character of
open or masked federalism</em>. Under no circumstances
could the sections be allowed to have separate sectional
treasuries, additional assessment of members of the sections
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>for organization and agitation and generally for
any work of the union, neither can they be allowed independent
representation outside of the union or to build
the leading union organs, committees, on the principle of
sectional representation.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. In exceptional cases of reconstruction of the existing
federated unions into a centralized industrial
union, only as an allowance for the transitional stage
the Executive Committee elected at the meeting of all
the delegates or at the meeting of the All-Russian Congress,
can be enlarged through the addition of representatives
of the sections, who then have no vote, only a
voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. All attempts to violate the principle of industrial
organization for the purpose of restoring the federated
trade unions by means of organization of the
inter-sectional bureaus uniting analogous sections of
the various industrial unions, must be emphatically condemned.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. Fighting for the complete annihilation of classes,
at this transitional period of proletarian dictatorship,
the Russian trade-union movement aiming at the union
of all workers into centralized industrial unions for the
purpose of subjecting the semi-proletarian elements to
the influence of the economically organized proletariat
and inducing it to enter the class struggle and take part
in Socialist reconstruction; we think it necessary to get
the new, and as yet unorganized, strata of government
and social workers to join the All-Russian Vocational
Associations, on condition of their complete submission
to proletarian discipline and to all regulations of the
leading central bodies of the trade union movement, and
particularly, the principles of organization.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. At the same time it would be the greatest error
at the present stage of development of our trade union
movement with its insufficient degree of organization,
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>to infuse into it the craftsmen and small shop owners
who due to their isolation and unorganized state, do not
allow of proletarian control; the same applies to the
labor “artels,” “unions of labor communes” and so-called
professional people who are not wage workers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being the representatives of the dying crafts and
petty bourgeois industry, these elements permeated with
the conservative economic ideology of individual and
small-scale production (artel), due to their numerical
size, are liable to disorganize the ranks of the economically
organized proletariat.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. Considering as the only correct and fundamental
basis for the union of the workers into industrial unions,
the economic basis (the economic part played by the
groups of laborers in the general system of national
economy), the All-Russian Vocational Association cannot
accept into its midst unions <em>built along national, religious,
and generally, any unions not built along economic
lines</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. Uniting the laborers and other employees into
unions, independently of their political and religious
beliefs, the Russian trade union movement as a whole,
taking the position of the international class struggle,
resolutely condemns the idea of neutralism, and considers
it a prerequisite for the admission of individual
unions into the all-Russian and local associations—that
they recognize the revolutionary class struggle for the
realization of socialism <em>by means of the dictatorship of
the proletariat</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. Regarding the Russian labor-union movement as
one close proletarian class organization, having one common
class aim—to win and organize the socialist system,
one must admit that <em>any member of any industrial
union</em>, affiliated with the all-Russian or local union council,
who is fulfilling his duties as such, being at the same
time a member of the All-Russian General Vocational
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>Association, upon being transferred from one industry
to another, <em>joins the proper union with the rights of an
old member</em>, without paying any initiation fee. No one
must be at the same time a member of two unions.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. This latter rule wholly applies also to the group
transfer of whole establishments from one union to another—<em>no
payments are to be made out of the treasury
of the unions, nor are to be made either to the members
who leave it or to the union into which they are transferred</em>,
by the first union.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. Endeavoring to better the economic conditions
of all the workers, regardless of whether they are members
of the union or not, the unions taking upon themselves
the responsibility for the proper functioning of
an establishment or institution, for the labor discipline
among the workers and the enforcement of the union
regulations of wages and standards of production, the
unions must endeavor <em>to introduce compulsory membership</em>
in all the establishments and institutions entering
into it, <em>through resolutions adopted at general meetings
of the workers</em>.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. Recognizing <em>the necessity of a united plan for the
construction of all trade unions</em> as the only condition insuring
right relations between the individual local organizations
and their centers, also insuring the enforcement
of union regulations and union discipline, the
second Congress thinks it necessary, for the purpose of
creating unity of activity on a local as well as national
scale, to adopt a united scheme for the structure of the
industrial unions and their combines.</p>

<h4 class='c028'><span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>2. <br /> THE STRUCTURE OF THE TRADE UNIONS AND SOVIETS:</h4>

<p class='c018'>1. The highest directing body of the all-Russian
labor union movement is the All-Russian Congress of
Trade Unions and the All-Russian Central Soviet of Vocational
Unions operating from one Congress to the
other, on the basis of principle regulations adopted by
the Congress.</p>

<p class='c033'><em>Note.</em> A conference is called only in case it is
impossible to call a properly organized congress.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. All regulations of the All-Russian Congresses,
Conferences and the All-Russian Central Council of the
Industrial Unions are compulsory not only to all the
unions, affiliated with the All-Russian Vocational Association,
but for every individual member of a union,
as well.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. <em>Violation of the rules and disregard of the same
on the part of individual unions</em> carries with it expulsion
of such a union from the family of the proletarian unions.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. The supreme organ of the All-Russian Industrial
Union is its Central Committee; all rulings of that committee
which do not contradict the regulations issued
by the higher councils of the All-Russian General Vocational
Association are obligatory for all of its branches
and for each and every one of its members.</p>

<p class='c000'>5. All local councils of the unions are being constructed
according to the plan of the All-Russian Central
Council of the Vocational Unions, with a corresponding
proportional change of numerical ratio. All
congresses of vocational unions are being called on the
principle of direct proportion.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span>6. The rulings of the All-Russian Industrial Unions
cannot be nullified by the rulings of the local councils
of unions and are obligatory for the organs of the given
union in each locality.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. The local councils of the Vocational Unions being
the leading organs of the labor union movement and authorized
representatives of the entire proletariat, economically
organized within a certain locality, are at the
same time guided in their activities by all the rules
of the All-Russian Congresses, Conferences and the All-Russian
Central Council of the Trade-Industrial Unions,
and as regards the branches of the industrial unions,
the regulations laid down by their guiding central bodies
are obligatory. The rulings of the local Trade Union
Councils which are in contradiction to the regulations
of the policy of the entire unions or their managing
bodies, are not obligatory for the local branches of the
industrial unions.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. The branches of the All-Russian Industrial
Unions affiliated with the All-Russian Central Trade
Unions Council automatically enter into the local Trade
Union Councils.</p>

<p class='c000'>9. The local Trade Union Councils are to see to it
that the unions are properly organized, and that they
follow the directions issued by the governing bodies and
fulfil their financial obligations towards the unions; they
are also to aid and support them in their activities.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. In the interests of centralization of union activity,
the strengthening of the ties between the centers
and the local bodies, and in order to place the finances
of the unions on a proper plane and bring about closer
cooperation and connection between the trade unions
on the one hand, and the organs of the Supreme Council
of National Economy and the Commissariat of Labor,
on the other, in the work of bringing about a uniform
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>structure of the Trade Unions and Union Councils
and standardizing the wage scales throughout the country,—one
must admit that the geographical (provincial)
amalgamations as well as the provincial Union Councils
are only unnecessary organs of transmission between
the center and the periphery which constitute a nonproductive
expenditure of energy and means.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. The All-Russian Centers, their branches and
subdivisions in the various localities, united through
the Trade Union Councils, constructed after the pattern
of the All-Russian Central Trade Union Council,
the Shop Committees or Employees’ Associations (Collective
Associations) as the original <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nuclei</span></em> of the trade
unions—this is the best scheme of organization structure,
answering the basic problems at the present moment
confronting the trade union movement. Territorial
grouping according to divisions and subdivisions
should be established by the All-Russian Central body
of the given union, depending upon the geographical
area and degree of concentration of any given branch
of industry, keeping, insofar as possible within the boundaries
fixed by the administrative divisions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only by observing the given scheme of organization
can the finances of the union be placed on a proper level
and the centers receive due financial strength, which
is a necessary condition for further and more systematic
activity.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. The most suitable principle by which to determine
the membership dues during the period of chronic
depreciation of paper money would be a proportional
assessment. The normal amount of membership dues,
the Congress considers is one per cent of the wages
earned. Special additional dues or assessments for
special needs of the local divisions of the industrial
unions are allowed only upon the resolution of general
meetings, or meetings of delegates or conferences of a
given union.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>13. Regarding the Branch of the Industrial Union
(within a province or region) as the highest organ of
the union in the given locality (government or region),
as the first step toward the actual realization of the
centralization of the union funds, the Congress considers
the following financial relations as necessary:</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>a</em>) Fifty per cent of all membership dues of the
branches of the All-Russian Central Industrial Union
go to the All-Russian Central Committee of the given
Industrial Union.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>b</em>) The divisions (district and sub-regional) of a
branch (government or region) of a Union work according
to the budget approved by the latter.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>c</em>) Ten per cent of all the funds remaining at the
disposal of a branch of a union goes to the local Trade
Union Council.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>d</em>) The local bureaus of the Trade Unions (in small
towns) exist on 10 per cent of the budget appropriated
by the branch of the industrial union to its divisions.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>e</em>) The local unions which are not affiliated with
any all-Russian union associations are to give 10 per
cent to the local Trade Union Council, and 10 per cent
to the All-Russian Central Trade Union Council transferred
through the local Trade Union Council.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. All trade organizations as well as members who
have not met their financial obligations within three
months without sufficient reasons, are automatically expelled
from their union and from the All-Russian Trade
Association, and can be reinstated only upon payment of
the sum they owe plus the usual initiation fee.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. The following initiation fees are to be fixed:
(<em>a</em>) half a day’s wages for individual members entering
the union, (<em>b</em>) the All-Russian Trade Union upon entering
the All-Russian Central Trade Union Council
pays 10 per cent of all the initiation fees collected from
the total number of its members, (<em>c</em>) the same amount
is paid by all the branches of the All-Russian Trade
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span>Unions upon their admission into the local Trade Union
Council, (<em>d</em>) the local unions which have no all-Russian
trade union pay upon entering the local council 10
per cent of the initiation fees collected, a half of which
amount goes to the All-Russian Central Trade Union
Council.</p>

<p class='c000'>16. In the interests of the development of union
activity with the present character of the Russian trade
union movement, all special funds which cannot be
touched, such as the strike fund, the reserve funds,
etc., must be annulled as such and added to the rest
of the union’s general treasury. The fund for the
aid of unions outside of Soviet Russia is being created
by the All-Russian Central Trade Union Council for
which purpose special collections and contributions are
to be used.</p>

<p class='c000'>17. In the interests of the proper arrangement of
the control system, the simplification and systematization
of the union’s business, we must make it obligatory
to have a single uniform system, as worked out by the
All-Russian Central Trade Union Council.</p>

<p class='c000'>18. The basic nucleus of the Industrial Union on
the spot is the Factory Committee or the Collective Association
of the office employees in the form of an Office
Workers’ Union.</p>

<p class='c000'>19. “Regulations of the Factory and Mill Committees”
adopted by the Moscow Trade Union Council
and approved by the All-Russian Central Council of
the Industrial Unions coordinated with the resolutions
of the present second All-Russian Congress of Trade
Unions must be used as the basis for the determination
of the part, the tasks and interrelations of the Factory
and Mill Committees with the other organizations.</p>

<p class='c000'>20. As a basis for the regulations governing the Employees’
Associations (Collective Associations), in addition
to the general principles which form the basis of the
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>“Factory and Mill Committee Regulations,” the following
principles are to be laid down:</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>a</em>) Participation in the hiring and dismissal of employees,
(<em>b</em>) obligatory participation in the Wage Scale
Committees and endeavor to see to it that the wage
scale regulations be carried out in practice, (<em>c</em>) the recognition
of the collective association and its rights to
exist only as an organ of the corresponding union, (<em>d</em>)
participation in the organization and improvement of
the technical apparatus of the given institution, (<em>e</em>) non-interference
with the general direction of the activities
of the state and social institutions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The All-Russian Central Trade Union Council is authorized
within the shortest time to work out and publish
the regulations of the Factory and Mill Committees
and the Employees’ Collective Associations.</p>

<p class='c000'>21. To avoid mixing up of terms and ideas regarding
the character of the union organs we must recognize
the uniform terminology of the same, as carrying out
the same functions, namely:</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>a</em>) All-Russian Central Trade Union Council retains
its name, (<em>b</em>) the leading organs of the All-Russian
Trade Unions are called “Central Committee of the
Trade Unions,” their executive organs are to be called:
“Presidium of the Central Committee of the Trade
Unions,” (<em>c</em>) their government (province) organs—“The
management of the government (province) or
regional branch of the All-Russian Trade Union,” (<em>d</em>)
the Local Government Trade Union Councils are called:
“Such and such Government Trade Union Council,” and
the district councils as well as the small town councils
“Such and such District Trade Union Bureau,” “Such
and such Trade Union Bureau.”</p>

<p class='c000'>22. All-Russian Central Trade Union Council on the
basis of the principles laid down, must work out in
the shortest possible period the following sample by-laws
which are to be obligatory for all trade organizations
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>affiliated with any of the following All-Russian
Trade Associations:</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>a</em>) The All-Russian Trade Union, (<em>b</em>) local union
having no corresponding all-Russian association, (<em>c</em>)
Local Trade Union Council, (<em>d</em>) Trade Union Bureau.</p>

<p class='c000'>23. The All-Russian Central Trade Union Council
must work out and enact through the People’s Commissariat
of Labor and the Soviet of National Economy or
the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, the regulations
governing the coalitions on the following basis:
(<em>a</em>) the right to be called a union is given only to trade
unions affiliated with the All-Russian Central Trade
Union Council, registered and published by the latter,
(<em>b</em>) all other organizations of an economic character not
affiliated with the All-Russian Trade Association are to
be called “societies.”</p>

<p class='c000'>24. The All-Russian Central Trade Union Council
and the government councils must periodically report
on all unions registered with it.</p>

<p class='c000'>25. In accordance with the general principles of organization,
adopted at the second Trade Union Congress
the corresponding amendments are to be introduced into
the by-laws of the All-Russian Central Trade Union
Council adopted by the first All-Russian Trade Union
Congress.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>BY-LAWS OF THE ALL-RUSSIAN CENTRAL TRADES UNION COUNCIL</h3>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>(<em>Amended and approved by the Congress</em>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>1. The All-Russian Trade Union Congress elects
an executive body of the All-Russian Central Trades
Union Council—the presiding officers (Presidium),
who are to submit a detailed report on their activity
to the following Congress.</p>

<p class='c000'>2. The supreme leading body of the All-Russian
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>Trade-Union Association is the All-Russian Central
Trade-Union Council, which is to be guided in its activity
by resolutions of congresses and conferences and
which is responsible for its actions to the All-Russian
Trades Union Congress.</p>

<p class='c000'>3. All the regulations of the All-Russian Congresses,
Conferences as well as those passed by the All-Russian
Central Trades Union Council are obligatory to all
unions affiliated with the All-Russian Trades Union
Association as well as to every union member. The violation
of these rules and disobedience of the same carries
with it expulsion from the family of proletarian
unions.</p>

<p class='c000'>4. The All-Russian Central Council is to fulfil the
following tasks:</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>a.</em>) It is to maintain and establish a connection with
all the existing and newly arising trade union organizations;</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>b.</em>) It is to aid in the creation of local all-Russian
vocational unions as well as the amalgamation of all
trades;</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>c.</em>) It is to establish connections with the central
trade union bodies of all countries;</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>d.</em>) It is to carry out all the necessary work connected
with the preparation and calling of All-Russian
conferences and congresses, it works out a program of
business to be transacted by the congresses, it takes
care of the preparation of reports, and it publishes the
fundamental principles;</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>e.</em>) It appoints the time for the calling of conferences
and congresses;</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>f.</em>) It periodically publishes in the press reports on
its activities;</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>g.</em>) It issues its bulletin (periodical organ);</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>h.</em>) It connects, and acts as representative for the
entire trade-union movement before the Central government
institutions and social organizations;</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>(<em>i.</em>) It aids the unions in their work of organization
and guides that work, for which purpose it issues various
by-laws, instructions, forms of accounting (book-keeping),
etc.;</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>j.</em>) It takes part in organizations and institutions,
serving the interests of cultural and educational activity
among the proletariat;</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>k.</em>) It aids in promoting the development of the
trade union movement, by means of verbal and written
propaganda and agitation.</p>

<p class='c000'>6. In order to accomplish its tasks successfully, the
All-Russian Central Trades Union Council organizes
the necessary departments.</p>

<p class='c000'>7. The funds of the All-Russian Central Trades-Union
Council consist of the following: (<em>a</em>) 10 per cent
of the membership dues collected by the Central Committees
of the All-Russian Trade Union Association;
(<em>b</em>) five per cent of the revenue coming from the local
unions not affiliated with the All-Russian Trade Unions,
but affiliated, through the local Soviet, with the All-Russian
All-Trades Association, (<em>c</em>) out of appropriations
designated by the organs of the Soviet Government
for specific purposes.</p>

<p class='c000'>8. The All-Russian Central Trade Union Council is
composed of the following:</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>a</em>) Nine members elected by the Congress, and</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>b</em>) Representatives of the All-Russian Trade
Unions, on the basis of one delegate to every 30,000 to
50,000 workers, and one more delegate to every additional
50,000 dues-paying members.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Note.</em> All-Russian Trades Unions whose membership
is below 30,000, send their representative, who has a
voice, but no vote. Unions whose dues-paying membership
is below 30,000 may unite and send a delegate to the
All-Russian Trades Union Council, who will then have
the right to vote at the meetings.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>9. The nine members elected by the congress are to be
the presiding officers of the All-Russian Central Council;
in order to effect a change in the composition of the
presidium, a vote of not less than two-thirds of the general
number of members of the All-Russian Central
Council is required, or if the All-Russian Associations
demand the recall of that body, the total membership
of the associations demanding such recall must exceed
one-half of the entire membership of the All-Russian
Association comprising all trades.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Note.</em> The members of the presidium (executive
committee), are to be replaced (in case they resign
or are recalled) at the plenary session of the All-Russian
Central Trade Union Council.</p>

<p class='c000'>10. Such recall and election of a new executive body
may take place only in extraordinary cases when the
general conditions do not permit the calling of an extraordinary
congress or conference.</p>

<p class='c000'>11. A plenary session of the All-Russian Central
Council takes place at least once a month. The All-Russian
Central Council at a meeting of all its members
elects an auditing committee and other committees and
responsible officers, leaving to the executive committee
(presiding officers) to organize branches (departments),
to invite workers to join them, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>12. The All-Russian Conference of Trades-Unions
is to consist of all the members of the council (Soviet),
and of representatives of provincial trades-union councils—one
to every 25,000 members.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Note.</em> Representatives of All-Russian Associations
who are admitted to the plenary session (<em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">plenum</span></em>) with
only a voice and no vote, have the right to vote at the
conference.</p>

<p class='c000'>13. The All-Russian Central Trades Union calls congresses
of the trades unions at intervals not longer than
one year. Extraordinary congresses are called at the
decision of the All-Russian Central Council, at the demand
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>of All-Russian Associations, or in cases where
the All-Russian Associations having not less than half
the total membership affiliated with the All-Russian
Workmen’s Association, demand that an extraordinary
convention be called.</p>

<p class='c000'>14. The right to representation at the Trades-Union
Congresses is restricted to those unions which in their
activity are guided by the principles of the international
class struggle of the proletariat, which are affiliated with
the local councils of the trades unions and which pay
their dues regularly.</p>

<p class='c000'>15. The following have a right to vote at the congress:</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>a</em>) The local trades unions having a dues-paying
membership of no less than 3,000, are entitled to one
delegate, and those whose membership exceeds 5,000 are
entitled to one delegate for every 5,000 dues-paying members
(complete 5,000 only, not for any fraction thereof).</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>b</em>) The central All-Russian Associations are entitled
to one delegate each; but in case the total number of
workers affiliated with them exceeds 10,000 they are entitled
to two delegates.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>c</em>) Petrograd and Moscow send three delegates each.</p>

<p class='c000'>(<em>d</em>) Local unions having under 3,000 members may

<p class='c000'>17. The rules of procedure for the congress (convention)
are worked out by the All-Russian Central
Council and are subject to approval by the congress.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>18. The order of business (program) to be transacted
at the convention is to be made public at least one
month before the congress is convened. Individual organizations
have the right to introduce new points into
the order of business not later than two weeks prior to
the meeting of the congress, of which changes the All-Russian
Central Council immediately notifies, through
the press, all the trades unions.</p>

<h3 class='c017'>ORDER OF ADMISSION OF ALL-RUSSIAN TRADES UNIONS INTO THE <br />ALL-RUSSIAN CENTRAL TRADES UNIONS COUNCIL</h3>

<h4 class='c028'>I</h4>

<p class='c018'>When the Soviet Government was first organized, a
number of purely financial questions arose which necessitated
the utilization of the services of the old financial-administrative
apparatus in the form in which it
existed prior to the October Revolution. It is quite
natural that the first period of work in the domain of
finance, that is, between the October Revolution and
the Brest-Litovsk Peace, had of necessity to be marked
by efforts to conquer the financial apparatus, its central
as well as its local bodies, to make a study of its own
functions and, somehow or other, to adapt itself to the
requirements of the time.</p>

<p class='c000'>While in the domain of the Soviet Government’s economic
and general policy, this period has been marked
by two most far-reaching and important changes which,
strictly speaking, had been prepared prior to the October
Revolution—the nationalization of banks and the
annulment of the government debt; the financial policy,
in the narrow sense of the word, did not disclose any
new departures, not even the beginnings of original constructive
work.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gradually taking over the semi-ruined pre-revolutionary
financial apparatus, however, the Soviet Government
was compelled to adopt measures for the systematization
of the country’s finances in their entirety.</p>

<p class='c000'>This second period in the work of the People’s Commissariat
for Finances (approximately up to August,
1918) also fails to show any features of sharply marked
<span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>revolutionary change. From the very beginning the
authorities have been confronted with a chaotic condition
of the country’s financial affairs. All this, in connection
with the large deficit which became apparent
in the state budget, compelled the Commissariat of Finance
to concentrate its immediate attention on straightening
the general run of things and, thus, prepare the
ground for further reforms.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to accomplish the systematizing of the financial
structure, the Government had to lean for support
on the already existing unreformed institutions, i.e.,
the central department of finance, the local administrative-financial
organs—the fiscal boards tax inspection,
treasuries, excise boards—and, more particularly, the
financial organs of the former local institutions for self-government
(Zemstvos, and municipalities).</p>

<p class='c000'>Such a plan of work seemed most feasible, since the
apparatus appeared suitable for fulfilling slightly modified
functions; but the local government was not yet
sufficiently crystallized or firmly established, neither
was any stable connection established between that local
government and the central bodies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under such circumstances, the old institutions, which
by force of habit continued to work exclusively at the
dictate of and in accordance with instructions from the
central bodies, seemed to be the most convenient and
efficient means of carrying out measures which the central
authorities had planned to straighten out the general
disorder prevailing in financial affairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, this idea soon had to be discarded, the local
Soviets insofar as they organized themselves and
put their executive organs into definite shape, could
not and did not have the right to neglect the work of
the old financial organs functioning in the various localities,
since the Soviets represented the local organs of
the central government as a whole, and since it was
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>upon them that the responsibility for all the work
done in the localities, rested.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under such conditions friction was inevitable. In
accordance with the principles of the old bureaucratic
order, the local financial institutions neither knew nor
had any idea of subordination other than the slavish
subordination to the central authorities which excluded
all initiative on their part.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under the new conditions, these local financial institutions
were to constitute only a small component part
of the local Soviets. Acute misunderstanding of the
local authorities among themselves and between the
local and central authorities on the subject of interrelations
among all of these institutions, have demonstrated
the imperative necessity for a reorganization. With
this work of reforming the local financial organs (September,
1918) a new period opened: the third period
in the activity of the commissariat, which coincides with
the gradual strengthening of the general course of our
economic policy. The economic policy definitely and
decisively occupies the first place which duly belongs
to it, while the financial policy, insofar as it is closely
bound up with the economic policy, is being regulated
and directed in accordance with the general requirements
of the latter.</p>

<h4 class='c028'>II</h4>

<p class='c018'>The financial policy of Soviet Russia was, for the first
time, definitely outlined by the eighth (March, 1919)
Convention of the Russian Communist Party.</p>

<p class='c000'>The eighth party convention clearly and concretely
stated our financial problems for the transitionary period,
and now our task consists in seeing to it that the
work of the financial organs of the Republic should be in
accord with the principles accepted by the party.</p>

<p class='c000'>These principles, briefly, are as follows: (1) Soviet
<span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>Government State monopoly of the banking institutions;
(2) radical reconstruction and simplifications of the
banking operations, by means of transforming the banking
apparatus into one of uniform accounting and general
bookkeeping for the Soviet Republic; (3) the enactment
of measures widening the sphere of accounting
without the medium of money, with the final object
of total elimination of money; (4) and, in view of the
transformation of the government power into an organization
fulfilling the functions of economic management
for the entire country,—the transformation of the pre-revolutionary
state budget into the budget of the economic
life of the nation as a whole.</p>

<p class='c000'>In regard to the necessity for covering the expenses
of the functioning state apparatus during the period
of transition, the program adopted outlines the following
plan: “The Russian Communist Party will advocate
the transition from the system of levying contributions
from the capitalists, to a proportional income and
property tax: and, insofar as this tax outlives itself, due
to the widely applied expropriation of the propertied
classes, the government expenditures must be covered
by the immediate conversion of part of the income derived
from the various state monopolies into government
revenue.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In short, we arrive at the conclusion that no purely
financial policy, in its pre-revolutionary sense of independence
and priority, can or ought to exist in Soviet
Russia. The financial policy plays a subsidiary part,
for it depends directly upon the economic policy and
upon the changes which occur in the various phases
of Russia’s political and economic order.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the transitional period from capitalism to
Socialism the government concentrates all of its attention
on the organization of industry and on the activities
of the organs for exchange and distribution of commodities.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span>The financial apparatus is an apparatus subsidiary to
the organs of production and distribution of merchandise.
During the whole of this transitional period the
financial administration is confronted with the following
task: (1) supplying the productive and distributive
organs with money, as a medium of exchange, not even
abolished by economic evolution, and (2) the formation
of an accounting system, with the aid of which the
government materialize the exchange and distribution
of products. Finally, since all the practical work in
the domain of national and financial economy cannot and
should not proceed otherwise than in accordance with
a strictly defined plan, it is the function of the financial
administration to create and compile the state budget
in such a manner that it might approximate as closely
as possible the budget of the entire national economic
life.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to this, one of the largest problems of
the Commissariat of Finance was the radical reform
of the entire administration of the Department of Finance,
from top to bottom, in such a manner that the
fundamental need of the moment would be realized most
fully—the realization of the dictatorship of the proletariat
and the poorest peasantry in the financial sphere.</p>

<h4 class='c028'>III</h4>

<p class='c018'>The work of the financial institutions for the solution
of the first problem of our financial policy, i.e., the
monopolization of the entire banking business in the
hands of the Soviet Government, may be considered as
having been completed during the past year.</p>

<p class='c000'>The private commercial banks were nationalized on
December 14, 1917, but even after this act there still
remained a number of private credit institutions. Among
these foremost was the “Moscow People’s Bank” (Moscow
Narodny Bank) a so-called cooperative institution.
There were also societies for mutual credit, foreign
<span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span>banks (Lion Credit Warsaw Bank, Caucasian Bank,
etc.); and private land banks, city and government
(provisional) credit associations.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally, together with the Moscow People’s Bank
there existed government institutions—savings banks,
and treasuries. A number of measures were required to
do away with that lack of uniformity involved and to
prepare the ground for the formation of a uniform
accounting system.</p>

<p class='c000'>A number of decrees of the Soviet of People’s Commissaries
and regulations issued by the People’s Commissariat
of Finance, have completed all this work from
September 1918 to May 1919.</p>

<p class='c000'>By a decree of October 10th, 1918, the Societies for
Mutual Credit were liquidated; three decrees of December
2nd, 1918, liquidated the foreign banks, regulated
the nationalization of the Moscow People’s (Cooperative)
Bank and the liquidation of the municipal banks;
and, finally, on May 17th, 1919, the city and state Mutual
Credit Associations were liquidated. As regards
the question of consolidating the treasuries with the offices
of the People’s Bank, this has been provided in a
decree issued on October 31st, 1918; the amalgamation
of the savings banks with the People’s Bank has been
affected on April 10th, 1918.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus, with the issuance of all the above-mentioned
decrees, all the private credit associations have been
eliminated and all existing Government Credit Institutions
have been consolidated into one People’s Bank of
the Russian Republic. The last step in the process of
reform was the decree of the People’s Commissariat of
Finance which consolidated the State Treasury Department
with the central administration of the People’s
Bank. This made possible, by uniting the administration
of these organs, the enforcement of the decree concerning
the amalgamation of the treasuries with the People’s
Bank. The decree of the People’s Commissariat of
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>Finance of October 29th, 1918, issued pursuant to Section
902 of rules on state and county financial organs,
practically ends the entire reform of uniting the treasuries
with the institutions of the Bank.</p>

<p class='c000'>This reform constitutes the greatest revolutionary
departure, in strict accordance with the instructions contained
in the party program. Prior to the completion
of this reform, the old pre-revolutionary principle continued
to prevail—that of opposition of the State Treasury
to the State Bank, which was independent financially,
having its own means, operating at the expense
of its capital stock, and acting as a depository for the
funds of the State Treasury and as its creditor. Insofar
as the new scheme of our financial life has been realized,
this dualism, has finally disappeared in the process
of realization of the reform. The Bank has now actually
become the only budget-auditing savings account
machinery of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic.
At the present moment it is serving all the departments
of the state administration, in the sense that
it meets all the government expenditures and receives
all the state revenue. It takes care of all accounting
between the governmental institutions, on the one hand,
and the private establishments and individuals on the
other. Through the hands of the People’s Bank pass
all the budgets of all institutions and enterprises, even
the state budget itself; in it is concentrated the central
bookkeeping which is to unify all the operations and to
give a general picture of the national economic balance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus, we may consider that the fundamental work,
i.e., "the monopolization of the entire banking business
in the hands of the Soviet Government, the radical alteration
and the simplification of banking operations
by means of converting the banking apparatus into an
apparatus for uniform accounting and general bookkeeping
of the Soviet Republic"—has been accomplished
by the Commissariat of Finance.</p>

<h4 class='c028'><span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span>IV</h4>

<p class='c018'>As regards the carrying into practice of a number of
measures intended to widen the sphere of accounting
without the aid of money, the Commissariat of Finance
has, during the period above referred to, undertaken
some steps insofar as this was possible under the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c000'>As long as the state did not overcome the shortage
of manufactured articles, caused by the general dislocation
of industrial life, and as long as it could arrange
for a moneyless direct exchange of commodities
with the villages, nothing else remains for it than to
take, insofar as possible, all possible steps to reduce the
instances where money is used as a medium of exchange.
Through an increase of moneyless operations between
the departments, and between the government and individuals,
economically dependent upon it, the ground
is prepared for the abolition of money.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first step in this direction was the decree of the
Soviet of People’s Commissaries of January 23rd, 1919,
on accounting operations, containing regulations on the
settling of merchandise accounts (products, raw material,
manufactured articles, etc.) among Soviet institutions,
and also among such industrial and commercial
establishments as have been nationalized, taken over by
the municipalities, or are under the control of the Supreme
Council of National Economy, the People’s Commissariat
for Food Supply, and Provincial Councils of
National Economy and their sub-divisions.</p>

<p class='c000'>In accordance with this decree, the above-mentioned
accounts are to be settled without the medium of currency,
by means of a draft upon the state treasury for
the amount chargeable to the consuming institution, and
to be credited to the producing institution, or enterprise.
In the strict sense, the decree establishes a principle,
in accordance with which any Soviet institution
<span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>or governmental enterprise requiring merchandise, must
not resort to the aid of private dealers, but is in duty
bound to apply to the corresponding Soviet institutions,
accounting, producing or distributing those articles.
Thus, it was proposed, by means of the above-mentioned
decree, to reduce an enormous part of the state budget
to the mere calculation of interdepartmental accounts,
income on one side and expenditures on the other. In
other words, it becomes possible to transact an enormous
part of the operations without the use of money
as a medium of exchange.</p>

<p class='c000'>As regards the policy of the Commissariat of Finance
in the domain of the circulation of money, one of the
most important measures in this respect was the decree
of the Soviet of People’s Commissaries of May 15th,
1919, on the issue of new paper money of the 1918 type.</p>

<p class='c000'>This decree states the following motive for the issue
of new money: “this money is being issued with the
object of gradually replacing the paper money now in
circulation of the present model, the form of which in
no way corresponds to the foundations of Russia’s new
political order, and also for the purpose of driving out
of circulation various substitutes for money which have
been issued due to the shortage of paper money.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The simultaneous issue of money of the old and new
type made it impossible for the Commissariat of Finance
to immediately commence the exchange of money, but
this in no way did or does prevent it from preparing
the ground for such exchange, in connection with the
annulment of the major part of the old money in a
somewhat different manner. Creating a considerable
supply of money of the new model (1918) and increasing
the productivity of the currency printing office,
the Commissariat is to gradually pass over to, in fact
has already begun, the issue of money exclusively of
the new type. A little while after the old paper money
has ceased to be printed, the laboring population, both
<span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span>rural and urban, as well as the Red Guards all of whom
are not in position to accumulate large sums, will soon
have none of the old money. Then will be the time to
annul the money of the old type, since this annulment
will not carry with it any serious encroachment on the
interests of the large laboring masses.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus the issue of new money is one of the most needed
first steps on the road to the preparation of the fundamental
problem, that is the annihilation of a considerable
quantity of money of the old type, reducing in this
way the general volume of the mass of paper money in
circulation.</p>

<p class='c000'>We thus see that here, too, the Commissariat of Finance
followed a definite policy. It goes without saying that
from the point of view of Socialist policy all measures
in the domain of money circulation are mere palliative
measures. The Commissariat of Finance entertains no
doubts as to the fact that a radical solution of the question
is possible only by eliminating money as a medium
of exchange.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most immediate problem before the Commissariat
of Finance is undoubtedly the accomplishment of the
process which has already begun, namely, the selection
of the most convenient moment for the annulment of the
old money. As regards the part which currency generally
(at this moment of transition) plays, there can
be no doubt that now it is the only and therefore inevitable
system of financing the entire governmental
machinery and that the choice of other ways in this
direction entirely depends upon purely economic conditions,
i.e., mainly upon the process of organization and
restoration of the national economy as a whole.</p>

<h4 class='c028'>V</h4>

<p class='c018'>The explanatory note, attached to the budget for July
to December, 1918, thus depicts our future budget:
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span>“When the Socialist reconstruction of Russia has been
completed, when all the factories, mills and other establishments
have passed into the hands of the government,
and the products of these will go to the government
freely and directly, when the agricultural and farming
products will also freely flow into the government stores
either in exchange for manufactured articles or as duty
in kind ... then the state budget will reflect not the
condition of the monetary transactions of the State
Treasury ... but the condition of the operations involving
material values, belonging to the State, and the
operations will be transacted without the aid of money,
at any rate without money in its present form.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It is clear that at present the conditions are not yet
fully prepared for the transition to the above-stated new
form of state budget. But, in spite of this, the Commissariat
of Finance has taken a big step forward in the
direction of reforming our budget.</p>

<p class='c000'>The budget of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet
Republic, adopted by the All-Russian Central Executive
Committee on May 20, 1919, represents the experiment
in effecting a survey not so much of the financial activity
of the state, as of its economic activity, even though
it is as yet in the form of money.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the work of reforming the budget, the Commissariat
of Finance has come across two obstacles which
are a heritage of the pre-revolutionary time: the division
of revenue and expenditures into general state and local,
and the hesitation on the part of some to include in the
budget all the productive and distributive operations of
the Supreme Council of National Economy and of the
Commissariat for Food Supply. Both, the first and
second obstacles have been somewhat surmounted, and
the above-mentioned (third) revolutionary budget is already
different from the two preceding budgets in many
peculiarities which are very typical. These consist in
a complete account of all production and distribution
<span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>which the state has taken upon itself. This experiment
is by no means complete, but the achievement should
nevertheless be judged as considerable. The concrete
conditions for making out the budget, as is stated in the
explanatory note, have already made it possible to enter
upon the road of accounting for the entire production
and distribution of the nation, and that thereby the
foundation has been laid down for the development of
the budget in the only direction which is proper under
the present conditions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The budget of the first half of 1919 has followed the
same fundamental principles for the construction of the
state budget by including the expenditures of the entire
state production and distribution as well as the sum total
of the revenue-in the form of income from the productive
and distributive operations of the state. In other
words, this budget for the first time takes into account
all the transactions of the Supreme Council of National
Economy and of the Commissariat for Food Supply.</p>

<p class='c000'>The further development of the budget will be directed
toward the working out of the details of this general
plan, and, in particular, toward differentiating revenue
and expenditures: (1) direct, actual money received or
paid, and (2) transactions involved in the accounting
of material and labor, but not involving any actual
receipts of money, or requiring any actual disbursements
in money.</p>

<h4 class='c028'>VI</h4>

<p class='c018'>In the field of taxation one must bear in mind first
that the entire question of taxation has been radically
changed with the beginning of Communist reconstruction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under the influence of the combined measures of economic
and financial legislation of the Republic, the bases
for the levying of land, real estate, industrial taxes,
taxes on coupons, on bank notes, on stock, stock exchange,
<span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>etc., completely disappeared, since the objects
of taxation themselves have become government property.
The old statute regulating the income tax (1916),
which has not as yet been abolished, was in no way suitable
to the changed economic conditions. All this compelled
the Commissariat of Finance to seek new
departures in the field of taxation.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, it was impossible to give up the idea of
direct taxation prior to the complete reformation of
the tax system as a whole. Our work of Communist reconstruction
has not been completed; it would be absurd
to exempt from taxation the former capitalists as well
as the newly forming group of people who strive for
individual accumulation. This is why the system of
direct taxation, which has until recently been in operation,
was composed of fragments of the old tax on
property and of the partly reformed income tax law.
However, beginning with November, 1918, to this old
system there were added two taxes of a purely revolutionary
character which stand out apart within the
partly outgrown system “taxes in kind” (decree of
October 30, 1918) and “extraordinary taxes” (November
2, 1918).</p>

<p class='c000'>Both decrees have been described as follows by Comrade
Krestinsky, Commissary of Finance, at the May
session of the financial sub-divisions:</p>

<p class='c000'>“These are decrees of a different order, the only thing
they have in common is that they both bear a class
character and that each provides for the tax to increase
in direction proportion with the amount of property
which the tax-payer possesses, that the poor are completely
free from both taxes, and the lower middle class
pays them in a smaller proportion.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The extraordinary tax aims at the savings which remained
in the hands of the urban and larger rural bourgeoisie
from former times. Insofar as it is directed at
non-labor savings it cannot be levied more than once.
<span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span>As regards the taxes in kind, borrowing Comrade Krestinsky’s
expression, “it will remain in force during the
period of transition to the Communist order, until the
village will from practical experience realize the advantage
of rural economy on a large scale compared with
the small farming estate, and will of its own accord,
without compulsion, <em><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</span></em> adopt the Communist
method of land cultivation.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus, the tax in kind is a link binding politically the
Communist socialized urban economy and the independent
individual petty agricultural producers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such are the two “direct” revolutionary taxes of the
latest period. In regard to the old system of pre-revolutionary
taxes, the work of the Commissariat of Finance
during all of the latest period followed the path of
gradual change and abolition of the already outgrown
types of direct taxation and partial modification and
adaptation to the new conditions of the moment, of the old
taxes still suitable for practical purposes.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the present moment the Commissariat of Finance
has entered, in the domain of direct taxation reforms,
upon the road toward a complete revolution in the old
system. The central tax board is now, for the transitional
period, working on a project of income and
property taxation, the introduction of which will liquidate
all the existing direct taxes, without exception. The
single tax which is being proposed, is so constructed that
it covers the very property of the citizen, i.e., it constitutes
a demand that the citizen yield that part of his
savings which is above a certain standard, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>In closing the review of the activity of the Commissariat
of Finance during the two years of its existence,
one must note briefly the great purely organizational
work, conducted by it on a natural as well as a local scale.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reform has been definitely directed towards simplifying
the apparatus and reducing its personnel as far
as possible.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span>Finally, with this reform, the Commissariat of
Finance has been organized in the following manner:
the central office, the central budget-accounting board
(former People’s Bank and Department of State
Treasury) and, finally, the central tax board (former
Department of Assessed Taxes and of Unassessed Taxes).
Upon the same pattern are also being modeled the local
financial bodies.</p>

<h4 class='c028'>A—OUR METAL INDUSTRY</h4>

<p class='c018'>The two years that have passed since the November
Revolution have been marked by civil war, which still
continues. Russia’s isolation from the outside world,
the loss and, later on, the recapture of entire provinces
of decisive importance to her industries, the feverish,
and therefore unsystematic, transfer of the industries
to a peace basis, and then, during the last year the reorganization
of the industries, the unusual conditions of
transportation, the fuel and the food questions, and as
a result of these, the question of labor power growing
more acute—this is the sad picture of conditions under
which the Russian proletariat has organized and maintained
the nation’s economic life.</p>

<p class='c000'>And though these familiar conditions of actual life
have affected all branches of industry, the greatest sufferer
in this respect has been the metal industry, which
forms the basis for our defence and the foundation for
all our industrial life.</p>

<p class='c000'>We might add here that the metal industry, and in
particular the metal working industry as its most complicated
and many-sided phase, both in assortment of
<span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span>products and in the nature of production, was by no
means strong in Russia even under the rule of the bourgeoisie.
As compared with the more developed capitalist
countries, the metal industry in Russia has been at a
disadvantage because of the very geographical situation
of its centers, remote from the sources of raw material
and fuel, artificially built up and having suffered all
the consequences of an unsound foundation. As a result
of these conditions, there is lack of specialization
and poor development of large scale production which
means a lack of the necessary prerequisites for successful
production.</p>

<p class='c000'>These are the external conditions under which the
administration of our metal industry has been compelled
to work.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first and most fundamental problem has been
that of systematic monopolization of industry. Only
under this form of industrial organization—if freed
from all the negative features of the capitalist trust,—is
operation possible, even on a reduced scale, so that
later on we might lay the solid foundations for new constructive
work in the organization of the nation’s economic
life of Socialist principles. The process of monopolization
may be considered as complete by this time.
Large associations have been formed, such as the trust of
united government machine shops “Gomza,” amalgamating
the largest mills producing the means of transportation
and machine construction, and the large metallurgical
mills, the trust of state copper working factories,
the trust of government automobile works, the trust of
government aviation work, the trust of government wire
nail, bolt and nut factories, the trust of the Maltzoff
Metallurgical mills, the association of the Kaluga metallurgical
mills (cast iron, utensils, and hardware), the
trust of the Podolsk mechanical and machine construction
shops the Petrograd mills for heavy production, the
Petrograd mills for medium machine construction, and
<span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>the Petrograd mills for heavy output (production on
large scale) are united under individual district administration
boards.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not all the enterprises consolidated within the associations
have become closely bound up among themselves
during this transitional period. In a matter of such
gigantic proportions mistakes have been, of course, inevitable
and they will have to be rectified. However,
the results of the experience of the last two years are
sufficient ground for the claim that the working class
has solved the problem of consolidating industry.</p>

<p class='c000'>The central administration of the Gomza mills thus
characterizes the significance of this consolidation: "The
consolidation of the mills working on transportation
equipment, working with the metallurgical group makes
it possible to utilize most efficiently all the resources
available, such as fuel, raw material, technical forces,
and the experience of the various mills with a view to
obtaining the best possible results under the existing
conditions. The amalgamation of the mills has already,
during the past year, made it possible to distribute
among them in the most rational manner, that inconsiderable
quantity of metal products and mineral fuel,
all products included, which the groups had in its possession.
This enabled the mills to adapt themselves to
the usage of local fuel. The concentration, even though
only partial, of some of the branches of the metallurgical
industry, also of the blacksmithing and iron foundry
branches, was made possible entirely by the amalgamation.
The specialization of the mills, according to the
types of steam engines, Diesel or other machines, has
been decided along general lines, by the Metal Department
of the Supreme Council of National Economy, and
the question is being worked out in closest cooperation
with the Technical Department of the “Gomza.” The
amalgamation of the mills will make it possible to carry
out gradually this specialization and utilize its results.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span>The central administration of the united mills states,
in a report of its activities, that owing to the consolidation
of the mills, the problems of supplying them with
raw material, fuel and labor power, were solved in a
fairly satisfactory way, thus placing production on a
more or less constant basis. The mills entering this combination,
if left to their own resources, would have been
doomed to a complete shutdown.</p>

<p class='c000'>The trust of the airplane building works has so completely
amalgamated all the mills, which entered the
combination that it now would be at a loss to determine
in advance which of the mills would perform any given
part of its program of production; to such an extent are
these mills bound up together through constant interchange
of fuel, raw material, supplies and even labor
power.</p>

<p class='c000'>The process of concentration of the industries in the
Ural region is being successfully carried out by the
Bureau of the Metal Department, through the organization
of district and circuit officers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Outside of the combine only those mills remained
where production is merely organized: the Moscow works
“Metal,” “Electrosteel,” “Scythe,” “Aviation Outfits,”
and the Satatov mill—“Star” (Zwezda). These
works are temporarily in the immediate charge of the
Metal Department.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Gomza trust during the entire period of its existence,
up to July 1st, 1919, has produced 69 new locomotives
and repaired 38 old ones; it has produced 1,744 new
and repaired 1,040 old coaches; it has completed 670
small cars; 261,327 poods of axles and tires; 7,543 poods
of switches; and 118,659 poods of various locomotive
and car parts. The table given below representing the
output for the first six months of 1919, as compared with
the same period for 1916 and 1918, of the Vyxunsk Mining
District, gives an idea of the work of the Department
of Metallurgy of our largest trust:</p>

<hr class='c036' />

<p class='c000'>It is apparent from the data given in the above table
that the total output for the first six months of 1919 was
almost 41 per cent of the total output for the corresponding
period of 1916, and 64.5 per cent of the total
product for the first half year of 1918, and 124.2 per
cent of the last six months of 1918. The figures expressing
the ratio of the total output of metal for the same
periods are respectively—91.4 per cent, 120.6 per cent
and 153.2 per cent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Taking into consideration the extremely difficult conditions
of production, the results may be considered satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c000'>If we turn to the production of another of our trusts—“Central
Copper Works” (Centromed), we note that
during the period of October to December, 1916, the
main Tula factory has produced 73.4 per cent of its capacity,
during January to June of 1919—89.9 per cent,
and finally during July and August of this year (1919)—about
87 per cent. The Kolchugin works have produced
the various articles of their manufacture during
the same periods in quantities which amounted to from
<span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span>16 to 48 per cent, 30 per cent to 77 per cent and 20 per
cent to 36 per cent of the quantities it was scheduled
to produce, while the samovar factories have produced
44 per cent of the scheduled output.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mills entering the association of the Central Aviation
Works have produced 36 per cent to 180 per cent
of the quantity they planned to turn out, while during
July, August and September of 1918 this percentage
ranged in the various mills and branches of production
from 26 per cent to 120 per cent.</p>

<p class='c000'>A comparatively considerable increase of production
has been noted on the works combined in the automobile
trust</p>

<p class='c000'>It would be absolutely impossible, within the limits
of a newspaper article, to amplify the illustration of
the above statements by means of statistical data, especially
in view of the fact that the data pertaining to
the latest period has not been arranged systematically.
However, the figures cited above, we trust, give some
idea of the process and results of the concentration of
industry and permit the deduction that the productivity
of labor in our large works, insofar as it did not completely
depend upon conditions which under the present
circumstances are insuperable,—has increased as
compared with that for the preceding year, and in some
exceptional cases, it has even arisen to the pre-war level.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nevertheless, our large industry has been getting into
even greater difficulties. A number of crises weighing
on it are breaking down its last forces. Of these the
most acute and serious are the fuel and food crises, the
latter demoralizing labor. This enforced comparative
idleness has been thoroughly utilized during the revolutionary
period, for the purpose of preparing for the
time when the external conditions would permit our
large industries to run at full speed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to the work of adapting our industry to
modern conditions of production (altering the mills to
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span>suit them to the usage of wood fuel, by changing the
construction of the furnaces and cupolas) the Technical
Council of the Metals Department of the Supreme Council
of National Economy is conducting the enormous
work of standardizing the industry and specializing the
mills by means of a detailed study of the individual
branches of industry. It is also engaged in the restoration
of the old, and in the organization of new, industries
on the basis of specialized labor and production on
a large scale. This latter task has been carried out
by a number of commissions organized by the Metal Department
of the Supreme Council of National Economy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Technical Council of the Metals Department conducted
its work chiefly on the plane of standardizing
production within the metal industry, reducing to a
minimum the types of construction of the same article.
Under capitalist conditions of production the law of
competition frequently led individual manufacturers to
deliberately flood the market with a multitude of various
constructions of the same machines in order to
compel the consumer purchasing a machine or implement
at a given mill, to buy all the parts and often have
his machine repaired in the same shop. It is needless
to point out to what extent this increased the cost of
production and, what is still more important, the cost
of exploitation. The Technical Council has tackled the
question not from an abstractly scientific viewpoint, but
from a practical standpoint, working in close cooperation
with our metal works. Every master part, every
detail is being worked out on the basis of data collected
at the mills by subcommittees consisting of specialists.
Then the project is submitted to the mills where the
necessary changes and coordination are suggested. The
comments given by the mills are compiled and revised,
before this or the other table or drawing is introduced;
the same applies to the technical specifications and assortments.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span>Master parts of three categories are being worked out:
(1) for the production of metal ware on a large scale,
(2) for general machine construction, (3) for the construction
of Diesel engines, which is now developing
into a general division of thermo-technics.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to this, a project is being completed for
a lathe designed for the needs of home industries, and
for repair work. A project is being worked out for
a series of lathes of all sizes, required for machine construction
shops.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides work on the standardization of industry, efforts
are also being made to lay down the technical conditions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the above mentioned committees, the following
deserve special mention:</p>

<p class='c000'>(1) The committee on steam turbine construction is
distributing orders for the construction of turbines of
various types. The Petrograd metal works and the Putiloff
wharf have already completed part of their orders.
In addition to this, the committee has investigated the
construction of steam turbines in Russia.</p>

<p class='c000'>(2) The committee on tractor construction has redistributed
and again alloted orders among the Obukhov
factory, the Mamin mill and the Kolomenksky mill for
75, 16 and 30 horse-power tractors. The drawings for
the latter type of tractor have been worked out by the
committee. Out of the number of tractors ordered at
the Obukhov works, the first three Russian-made tractors
are already completed. The others will be turned
out in January and in June of 1920. It is proposed
to organize the production of tractors on a large scale
at the new Vyxunsk mill, the building of which is being
completed.</p>

<p class='c000'>(3) The committee on the construction of gas generating
installations which has determined the basic type
of gas generating engine most suitable for the conditions
of Russian machine construction, has standardized
<span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>the normal power of the engines; it has also outlined
the preliminary measures for the adaptation of certain
mills to large scale production of gas-generating engines.</p>

<p class='c000'>(4) The committee for the development and improvement
of steam boiler construction in Russia, has prepared
the material and worked out detailed conditions
for a contest of stationary water-tube boilers, the cheapest
as to cost of production and the most economical in
operation to be adopted by the committee. The committee
also prepares the conditions for a contest on the
production of a mechanical stoker, having investigated
possible productivity and modern methods of production
of steam boilers in Russia.</p>

<p class='c000'>(5) The committee on the construction of refrigerating
machinery ascertained the requirements for 1919–1920
in the line of refrigerating machinery; it is laying
down and determining the types of refrigerating machines
and apparatus that would be most desirable; it
is working out the construction of the same, etc. Finally,
it has drawn up plans for the construction of refrigerator-barges
to sail regularly on the Volga between
Astrakhan and Rybinsk.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to the above-mentioned commissions, the
Metal Department has a number of committees now
functioning, such as the committee in charge of supplying
the country with high grades of steel, having a technical
convention of its own the committee on the organization
of the Ural industries, the committee on locomotive
construction, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>As we have mentioned before, simultaneously with
rendering support to large industries and taking steps
for their conversion to normal conditions, particularly
careful attention had to be given to the intermediate,
small and home industries.</p>

<p class='c000'>Intermediate industry comprises almost all of the agricultural
machine construction, under the direction of
the agricultural machinery section of the Metal Department
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span>of the Supreme Council of National Economy. This
section operates in close contact with the local governing
bodies in charge of the people’s industries: provincial,
councils of national economy. According to the data of
the section, covering the period of October 1st, 1918 to
October 1st, 1919, the following simple as well as complicated
agricultural machines and implements have
been produced:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c037'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>147,453 ploughs</div>
      <div class='line in2'>3,717 winnowing machines</div>
      <div class='line in2'>1,440 straw cutters</div>
      <div class='line in1'>11,451 harrows</div>
      <div class='line in1'>98,689 scythes</div>
      <div class='line'>684,420 sickles</div>
      <div class='line in1'>11,980 harvesting machines</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>For the purpose of organizing the production of
scythes in the most efficient manner possible the agricultural
machine section created a special Scythes Bureau,
which is investigating this line of production, ascertaining
the possible amount of productivity if manufactured
in the machine shop manner or according to the home
industry method, both in the central provinces and in
the Ural region. The bureau has laid down a plan for
radical change in the nature of production by means of
splitting it into two fundamental processes: the metallurgical—the
rolling of steel of worked out profile; and
the finishing process in the mills and shops. For the
purpose of rolling the metal it has been proposed to
utilize the Vyxunsk mill, which has been requested to
include in its program the rolling of steel for the production
of scythes.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the field of home industry production on a small
scale the committee on metal products and apparatus
of the Metal Department is working in close cooperation
with other government institutions, having organized
agencies in Pavlovsk, Tula, Murom, and Vladimir,
for the purpose of financing artisans and distributing
<span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span>raw material among them on the one condition that
they turn in their product to the government stores
for organized distribution. The results of this work can
be judged by the following approximate data on the
cost of manufactured products, the stock on hand from
previous year returned to the factories and enterprises
of the Murom, Pavlovsk, Tula region, as well as to the
group of cast iron foundries of the provinces of Kaluga
and Ryazan.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Murom district, manufacturing cutlery and to
some extent also instruments, has turned out, during
the period following the organization of the government
agency, 15 million roubles’ worth of goods, while the
total worth of it, including remnants returned, amounts
to 25 million roubles; the Pavlovsk district engaged in
the manufacture of cutlery, locks and instruments,—among
others, surgical instruments—has produced since
October 1st, 1918, 70 million roubles’ worth of merchandise;
including the remnants, this would aggregate
to 100 million roubles. The Tula district (hardware,
locks, stove accessories, samovars, hunters’ rifles), has
produced since May 1919, 30 million roubles’ worth
of goods, which, including the remnants, amount to 60
million roubles. The cast-iron foundries of the Kaluga
and Ryazan districts (manufacturing cast-iron utensils,
stove accessories and various other castings) have produced
since October 1st, 1918, 50 million roubles’ worth
of merchandise, including the remnants.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus, the total amount of goods produced amounts
to 165 million roubles,—or to 235 million roubles, if
the value of the remnants is added,—taking 40 as the
co-efficient of its value according to peace-time prices.</p>

<p class='c000'>The central administration could not take upon itself
the direct organization of home industries to the
full extent. Its best assistants in this matter are the
local institutions of national economy—the provincial
and district metal committees, which have been brought
<span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span>in close contact with the central administration by the
conventions of the representatives of the district and
provincial metal committees. These conventions were
being called at regular intervals for the purpose of working
out and ratifying their programs concerning production
and distribution of metals, and financial questions.</p>

<p class='c000'>We must also mention the fact that all the measures
in the domain of the metal industry are being carried
out with the close and immediate cooperation of the
workers’ producing association—the union of metal
workers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus, as has been proven from practical experience,
the methods and forms of organization of the metal industry
have turned out to be correct. Their application
is therefore to be continued and widened, strengthening
the ties binding these organizations with the local
administrative bodies, such as the provincial and
district metal committees and with the central management
of the amalgamated enterprises.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great obstacle in the path of future development
in our metal industry is the food question, which carries
with it the dissolution of labor power. Considering
the fact that circumstances have compelled our industry
in general, and particularly the metal industry, to
supply chiefly the needs of national defence, to which
it is necessary to give right of way over all other interests,
the authorities and the labor organizations must
do everything in their power to avert the food crisis
threatening the metal workers, even if this be to the
detriment of the population.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is necessary not only to cease all further mobilization
of laborers and responsible workers, but also to
select a considerable portion of those already mobilized
for the purpose of transferring them from the army into
industry.</p>

<p class='c000'>The course of work of the metal industry during the
past two years gives us reason to hope that these measures,
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span>if introduced systematically, might make it possible
to cope with the difficult external conditions and
furnish a mighty stimulus for preparing the metal industry
for the needs of peaceful construction.</p>

<h4 class='c028'>THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RURAL INDUSTRIES <br /> <span class='small'>B—FROM “ECONOMIC LIFE,” Nov. 7, 1919.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The Supreme Council of National Economy has put
into practice the idea of nationalization of all our industries:
at present there is not one mill or factory
of any considerable size that is not the property of the
people.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the second year of its existence, the Supreme
Council of National Economy has made some headway
in the work of nationalization of land. As a particular
instance we might cite the fact that it was upon the
initiative and due to the energetic efforts of the Supreme
Council of National Economy that the land fund for
the sugar industry has been nationalized. The total
area of land nationalized for the sugar industry amounts
to 600,000 dessiatins.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sugar-beet industry has furnished the initial step
in the development of the rural industries, since this
particular industry has been better preserved during
the transitional period of the Revolution. The alcohol
industry occupies the next place. Its development has
been begun by the Supreme Council of National Economy
during the last few days.</p>

<p class='c000'>These two large branches of rural industry are followed
by a number of lesser significance, such as the
<span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span>production of starch, molasses, butter, milk, tobacco,
medicinal herbs, the group of fibre plants, etc. The
Supreme Council of National Economy is now laying
a solid foundation for the development of all these industries.</p>

<p class='c000'>What then is the program of action of the Supreme
Council of National Economy for the development of
the rural industries? In the first place, to supply definite
land areas for the cultivation of certain plants, the
introduction of definite forms of agricultural labor, and
of uniform management for the manufacturing and agricultural
industries, the establishment of close connections
between the industrial proletariat and the citizens
engaged in the rural industries.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the problems enumerated above, foremost is
that of uniting the industrial proletariat with the rural
workers. The Supreme Council of National Economy
has already begun to work on this task. Thus the industrial
proletariat is now officially in possession of 90,000
dessiatins of land, on which communes have been organized.
The crops from these estates go to satisfy the
needs of the associations in whose name the estates are
registered. At the same time, the industrial proletariat,
through participation in agricultural labor, is introducing
new ideas into the rural industries.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Supreme Council of National Economy is mining
the coal from the depths of the earth and exploiting the
peat deposits. In order to utilize the resources completely,
it is paying particular attention to the conversion
of swampy areas and exhausted turf deposits into
areable land, transforming the bottom of the exploited
turf areas into vegetable gardens, the sections bordering
upon the swamps into artificial meadows, and the
uplands into fields. During last summer similar work
was accomplished on a considerable scale on the lands
of the central electric station, in the Government of Moscow,
the Ilatur electric station, in the Government of
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span>Ryazan, Gus-Hrustalny, in the Government of Vladimir,
and the Gomza estates in the Government of Nizhni-Novgorod.
Thus, during last summer, the work was
organized in four central provinces, abounding in large
areas of land, which cannot be conveniently used for
agricultural purposes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Simultaneously the improvement of dwellings, and the
building of garden-cities is being given careful and immediate
consideration. This work is being carried on
by the Supreme Council of National Economy at the
electric station of Kashirsk, the Shatur station and the
Central Electric station.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to unify rural industries the Supreme Council
of National Economy has formed the central administration
of agricultural estates and industrial enterprises,
assigning to it the task of uniting and developing
as far as possible, the work of the rural mills.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Central Administration of Agriculture considers
it one of its immediate problems to propagate widely
the idea of nationalization of land for all rural industries
and the opening of new districts for those industries.</p>

<p class='c000'>In apportioning the land, especially valuable districts
should be set apart, such as the meadows, flooded with
water from the Don river, fully suitable for the cultivation
of tobacco, fibre plants, and olives, on a large
scale.</p>

<p class='c000'>These lands, if distributed among the peasants will
never yield such wealth as they could do were they nationalized
for rational exploitation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next on the program of the Central Administration
of Agriculture is the building up of new branches of rural
industry, such as the working of sugar beets into molasses
and into beet flour, in the northern districts, the
production of ammonium sulphate out of the lower
grades of peat, the preparation of fodder out of animal
refuse, the production of turf litter material, the preparation
<span class='pageno' title='270' id='Page_270'></span>of new sources of nitrate fertilizer out of peat,
etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>Electric power must be utilized for the cultivation
of land. The practical realization of this problem has
been started on the fields of the electric power transmission
department. This Fall we succeeded in tilling
the ground by means of a power-driven plow.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to build up the rural industries, practical
work must be carried on, simultaneously with that which
is being done on the particularly important lands, also
on such lands as will not be the bone of contention between
the proletariat and the peasantry.</p>

<p class='c000'>What lands are these? The swampy areas, the forest-covered
lands, those districts where the people are starving,
the dry lands, the scarcely populated districts, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>These are the brief outlines of the program. The
foundations of absolutely all of the development of
rural industry mentioned have been laid down. The
practical steps for the materialization of the plans have
to some extent already been, or are being, undertaken.</p>

<p class='c000'>All of this work the Supreme Council of National
Economy had to carry out under extremely difficult conditions.
Prior to that, a considerable part of the sources
of raw material for the rural industries has been completely
torn away from the Soviet Republic. Another
serious hindrance was the insufficient number of already
existing organizations, which would be capable of fulfilling
the tasks outlined by the Council. A considerable
amount of harm has been done to this work by interdepartmental
friction.</p>

<p class='c000'>But difficult as the present conditions may be, and
no matter how strong is the desire of the former ruling
classes to turn back the tide of life, this is impossible
and can never take place.</p>

<div class='c020'>CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION OF AGRICULTURE.</div>

<hr class='c016' />
<h4 class='c028'><span class='pageno' title='271' id='Page_271'></span>NATIONALIZATION OF AGRICULTURE <br /> <span class='small'>C—FROM “ECONOMIC LIFE,” Nov. 7, 1919.</span></h4>

<p class='c018'>The nationalization of agriculture is one of the most
complicated problems of the Socialist Revolution, and
perhaps in no other country is this problem as complex
as in Soviet Russia.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the time when the decree on Socialist land management
was made public, the fundamental elements of
nationalization had hardly begun to take shape: the territory
affected by nationalization was by no means defined;
there was not the personnel necessary for the
creation and enforcement of any plan concerning production;
the large masses of laborers hardly understood
the idea of nationalization and in some instances were
hostile to the measures by means of which the Soviet
power was carrying out the program of nationalization.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to summarize the results of the work, which
began on a nation-wide scale in March, 1919, and to
estimate these results, one must first realize the conditions
which formed the starting-point for the work of
the People’s Commissariat of Agriculture at the time
when it commenced to carry out the nationalization of
agriculture.</p>

<p class='c000'>The extent of the capitalist heritage, which our organized
Soviet estates now have at their disposal,
amounts to 615,503 dessiatins or areable land, situated
in the Soviet provinces and formerly in the hands of
private owners. Eighty-five per cent of the areable
land, which formerly belonged to the landed aristocracy
was taken over for the purpose of both organized and
non-organized distribution—chiefly the latter.</p>

<p class='c000'>The equipment of the various estates was diminished
and destroyed to no lesser extent. Instead of the 386,672
privately owned horses, registered in the Soviet
provinces, according to the census of 1916, the Soviet
<span class='pageno' title='272' id='Page_272'></span>estates in the hands of the People’s Commissariat of
Agriculture received 23,149 horses—a number hardly
sufficient for the cultivation of one-third of the area
under cultivation now belonging to the Soviet estates.
Of the 290,969 cows—only 43,361 came into the possession
of the Soviet estates. The entire number of horses
and cows will yield sufficient fertilizer for only 13,000
dessiatins of fallow land, i.e., about 10 per cent of the
area intended to be converted into areable land.</p>

<p class='c000'>The supply of agricultural machinery and implements
was in the same condition.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Soviet estates had almost no stocks of provisions.
The workmen were compelled either to steal or to desert
for places where bread was more abundant.</p>

<p class='c000'>The winter corn was sowed in the fall of 1918 on
very limited areas (not over 25 per cent of the fallow
land), very often without fertilizer, with a very small
quantity of seeds to each dessiatin. In 13 out of 36
Soviet provinces (governments) no winter corn has been
sowed at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>A considerable portion of the estates taken over by
the People’s Commissariat of Agriculture could not be
utilized due to the lack of various accessories, such as
harness, horseshoes, rope, small instruments, etc.</p>

<p class='c000'>The workers were fluctuating, entirely unorganized,
politically inert—due to the shortage of provisioning
and of organization. The technical forces could not get
used to the village; besides, we did not have sufficient
numbers of agricultural experts familiar with the practical
organization of large estates. The regulations governing
the social management of land charged the representatives
of the industrial proletariat with a leading
part in the work of the Soviet estates. But torn between
meeting the various requirements of the Republic of
prime importance, the proletariat could not with sufficient
speed furnish the number of organizers necessary
for agricultural management.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='273' id='Page_273'></span>The idea of centralized management on the Soviet
estates has not been properly understood by the local
authorities, and the work of organization from the very
beginning had to progress amidst bitter fighting between
the provincial Soviet estates and the provincial offices
of the Department of Agriculture. This struggle has
not yet ceased.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus, the work of nationalizing the country’s agriculture
began in the spring, i.e., a half year later than it
should have, and without any definite territory (every
inch of it had to be taken after a long and strenuous
siege on the part of the surrounding population), with
insufficient and semi-ruined equipment, without provisions,
without an apparatus for organization and without
the necessary experience for such work, with the
agricultural workers engaged in the Soviet estates having
no organization at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>According to our preliminary calculations, we are to
gather in the Fall of this year a crop of produce totaling
in the 2,524 Soviet estates as follows:</p>

    <td class='c025'>4,500,000</td>

  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c000'>Of the Winter corn we received only a little over what
was required for seed (in a number of provinces the
crops are insufficient for the consumption of the workers
of the Soviet estates).</p>

<p class='c000'>The Soviet estates are almost everywhere sufficiently
supplied with seeds for the spring crops.</p>

<p class='c000'>The number of horses used on the Soviet estates has
been increased through the additional purchase of 12,000
to 15,000.</p>

<p class='c000'>The number of cattle has also been somewhat increased.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span>The Soviet estates are almost completely supplied with
agricultural implements and accessories, both by having
procured new outfits from the People’s Commissariat for
Provisioning and by means of energetic repair work on
the old ones.</p>

<p class='c000'>The foundation has been laid (in one-half of the provinces
sufficiently stable foundations) for the formation
of an organizational machinery for the administration
of the Soviet estates.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within the limits of the Soviet estates the labor union
of the agricultural proletariat has developed into a
large organization.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a number of provinces the leading part in the
work of the Soviet estates has been practically assumed
by the industrial proletariat, which has furnished a
number of organizers, whose reputation had been sufficiently
established.</p>

<p class='c000'>Estimating the results of the work accomplished, we
must admit that we have not as yet any fully nationalized
rural economy. But during the eight months of
work in this direction, all the elements for its organization
have been accumulated.</p>

<p class='c000'>We have strengthened our position in regard to supplies,
having been enabled not only to equip more efficiently
the Soviet estates (2,524) already included in
our system of organization, but also to nationalize during
the season of 1920 additional 1,012 Soviet estates,
with an area of 972,674 dessiatins. The combined area
of the nationalized enterprises will probably amount
in 1920 to about 2,000,000 dessiatins within the present
Soviet territory.</p>

<p class='c000'>A preliminary familiarity with individual estates and
with agricultural regions makes it possible to begin the
preparation of a national plan for production on the
Soviet estates and for a systematic attempt to meet the
manifold demands made on the nationalized estates by
the agricultural industries: sugar, distilling, chemical,
<span class='pageno' title='275' id='Page_275'></span>as well as by the country’s need for stock breeding,
seeds, planting and other raw materials.</p>

<p class='c000'>The greatest difficulties arise in the creation of the
machinery of organization. The shortage of agricultural
experts is being replenished with great difficulty,
for the position of the technical personnel of the Soviet
estates, due to their weak political organization, is extremely
unstable. The mobilization of the proletarian
forces for work in the Soviet estates gives us ground to
believe that in this respect the spring of 1920 will find
us sufficiently prepared.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ranks of proletarian workers in the Soviet estates
are drawing together. True, the level of their enlightenment
is by no means high, but “in union there is
strength” and this force, if properly utilized, will yield
rapidly positive results.</p>

<p class='c000'>In order to complete the picture of the agricultural
work for the past year we are citing the following figures:
the total expenditures incurred on the Soviet estates
and on account of their administration up to January
1st, 1920, is estimated to amount to 924,347,500
roubles. The income, if the products of the Soviet estates
are considered at firm prices, amounts to 843,372,343
roubles.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus, the first, the most difficult year, has ended without
a deficit, if one excludes a part of the liabilities
which are to be met during a number of years, i.e.,
horses and implements.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course, it is not the particular experience which the
workers possess that has caused the favorable balance
of the Soviet estates, this being mainly due to the fact
that the productive work in the realm of agriculture under
modern conditions is a business not liable to lose.</p>

<p class='c000'>And this is natural: industry in all its forms depends
upon the supply of fuel, raw material, and food. Nationalized
rural economy has an inexhaustible supply of
<span class='pageno' title='276' id='Page_276'></span>solar energy—a fuel supply independent of transportation
of the blockade.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fundamental element of production—land—does
not demand any “colonial” means of restoration of its
productivity. And as for provisions, these we get from
the earth under the sun!</p>

<p class='c000'>After eight months of work on the nationalization of
our rural economy, as a result of two years of titanic
struggle on the part of the proletariat for the right to
organize the Socialist industries with its own hands,—is
it not high time to admit that the most expedient, most
far-sighted, and correct method to stabilize the Soviet
power would be to use the greatest number of organized
proletarian forces for the work of nationalizing our agriculture?</p>

Transcriber’s Note</p>

<p class='c000'>The page reference in the list of Illustrations to p. 54
(LENIN AT HIS DESK IN KREMLIN, 1919) is incorrect. The
photograph appears facing p. 50. The entry has been corrected.</p>

<p class='c000'>On p. 149, a train station town is variously spelled
‘Kreisberg’ and ‘Kreizberg’. Both are retained.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Appendix, the organizational names of various
Unions are variously called ‘Trades’ or ‘Trade’. No attempt
was made to make them consistent.</p>

<p class='c000'>On p. 257, the quoted passage beginning "The consolidation of
the mills..." has no closing quote, and it is unclear where it
might have been intended.</p>
